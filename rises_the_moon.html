“Partner?” Yugi’s voice sounded so small in this space. Why was Yami here? Or, maybe the real question was, why were they separated? They were always together, weren’t they? Where was his partner?

“Partner, I’m here! Where are you?”

Did Yami sound closer or farther away than he did the first time he spoke? Yugi couldn’t tell.</span>

That was why Shadi had never been punished- why he helped him out. It was to protect them, scare him away. The truth was, he didn&#39;t know heads or tails of this place either. Some nights had been spent wandering the halls, checking places here or there. But never deep- afraid he would lose himself, never come back out. 

He ran up a set of stairs, then another. His legs felt weak, like they were full of lead. He panted, trying to catch his breath against a door. It fell open, and he stumbled, narrowly missing one of the traps inside. Fire singed his back, but nothing more. What if Yugi opened one of the doors-?

<em>&quot;Partner!&quot;</em> He called, <em>&quot;Do not open the doors! I will find you!&quot;</em> 

He ascended another set of stairs. Yami&#39;s heart hammered. Why was dread taking such a hold of him? He would find him, and all would be well. This was a maze of his own heart. It would lead him to what he cherished most. 

Right?</span>

Nervous, he climbed down some stairs. He tried to ignore that he could see his own breath in front of him. The cold was only making his anxiety rise.  What if he never found his partner? What if he never found his way out? What if he was stuck here forever?

What if his partner was behind one of these doors? He&#39;d been avoiding them, but...

He threw it open. He narrowly managed to avoid getting crushed by the walls of the room closing in on him. 

&quot;Partner... Where are we...&quot;</span>

Did he have to enter a door to get to him? He opened. A spear flew out, and stabbed his shoulder. His scream was soundless. He had- he had to be strong.</span>

“You’re not… My partner doesn’t <em>have</em> memories. He has mine, he doesn’t need…”

Or, there was another option.

“…My memories aren’t enough for…”

Someone masquerading as his partner, or his partner rejecting the memories Yugi shared with him. Which was worse? Both were painful. But perhaps the most painful of all…

The other Yugi, standing in front of him. His third eye glowing, eyes burning with fury. Not a hint of compassion within him.

“Other me…” The other Yugi he used to fear.

Tears falling down his face, Yugi turned and ran.</span>

What was going on? Why wasn&#39;t Yugi listening to him!! He needed him to, they needed to get out of here, Yugi was going to get hurt and-

His memories. He spoke too much. He didn&#39;t care of those memories! He cared about <em>Yugi!</em> His soul, his heart, the warmth they shared, that was worth all the gold in the world, he would burn down the Valley of Kings before he let himself lose Yugi. 

So he ran. 

He chased him. 

But his legs were betraying him. He stumbled, he grabbed onto a door handle, and the door swung open. More of a gap between them. 

He pushed to stand. Inside of the room was a simple mirror. 

Yami stared. His eyes were dark, his third eye bright and clear. The blood on his shoulder made him look like a monster. He reached out, touching his face, trying to see if it was a trick. But all he succeeded in doing was smearing blood on his cheek. 

He stood up. 

<em>&quot;YUGI!&quot;</em> He called. He couldn&#39;t see him anymore. <em>&quot;Please- please, where did you go?! Please, let us leave this place together!&quot;</em></span>

Who would want to leave the place that held their memories? This Yami must be a trick, somehow.</span>

Yami pushed further, trying to follow the sounds of his footprints. The cold felt like it was searing his hot skin. He felt feverish. The world felt like it was crumbling before him- those fearful eyes were <em>never</em> meant to look upon him again. 

<em>&quot;Other self! Return to me at once!&quot;</em>

It did not sound like him. He did not seem aware of it. His voice boomed, echoed, and finally- <em>finally</em>, he felt some measure of control over the place. Control. That was it. He just needed control, and everything would be alright again.</span>

And the world stopped. The word had commanded itself from his chest, but he only barely registered it was his own. Registered what he was even <em>doing.</em> 

He was about to deal Yugi a penalty game. 

This time it was his turn to take a step back. Fear washed over him. How easily he lost his control, how easily he had succumbed to his older self, the self he had sworn to grow from-

<em>I am a demon,</em> he thought, unable to move. He stared at Yugi with wide eyes. <em>I was going to capture him like prey. My- my <strong>partner.</strong></em>

And the cold rushed back in. Yami felt dizzy, the maze closing in on him again. This time, he did not run. He sunk to the floor, just shy of the exit. 

He did not go after him. Did not chase his partner out the door, did not run for his dearest. Instead, he pulled his legs up to press against his chest. His shoulder&#39;s pain was negligible. Maybe, he thought, if he was lucky he would just bleed out here, and fall into some endless slumber. 

At least then Yugi would be free of the beast hunting for his heart. 

He did not cry. Some part of him thought this was inevitable. It was foolish to run from his memories, run from whatever he had been before. If he was a king, he must have been a tyrant. A blasphemous ruler who took no pride or compassion for his people. For those he cared about.

For those he loved. 

But it didn&#39;t matter. Yugi&#39;s memories, or his old ones, he deserved neither. For this, his own penalty game. 

He looked to his side. His shadow was there, looking at him. Eyes bright. He reached down, and touched it. His hand pressed through it, and he let himself fall into the darkness. The last thing that escaped him, was one last painful wail, ripping from his throat and swallowed by his old self.</span>

If Yugi had been dreaming, he didn&#39;t remember it. It was gone now, swallowed up by the darkness. But if not a dream, what did wake him up? It was still late in the night, the world around him dark. 

&quot;Partner...&quot;

...Oh. That must have been what woke him up. He shot up into a sitting position, looking around him, but no one was here. He was alone. He was alone...

&quot;Partner! Where are you?&quot;

He tried to reach out, both internally and externally, but he couldn&#39;t find his partner. Panic began to settle in. What happened? Did something happen to Yami?

&quot;Partner!&quot;</span>

He stumbled back. He pressed his body to it, like he would melt back into it. His eyes were wide. He looked on with <em>fear.</em> It was rare for him- and most of all, to Yugi. There was the lightest shimmer to his eyes. Had he been crying? 

He didn&#39;t say anything. He couldn&#39;t. He throat was so tight, it felt completely shut.</span>

Yugi scrambled out of bed. Something wasn&#39;t right. His partner was being quiet, and the look in his eyes-- had he ever seen that expression on Yami&#39;s face before?

He rushed to his partner&#39;s side. Reached out for him, though a bit hesitantly. &quot;Partner, what&#39;s wrong? What happened?&quot;</span>

He’d wade through the strongest currents of emotion for his dear partner.

The mention of a penalty game, the reminder of the nightmare he’d experienced not long ago, nearly tipped him over, though. 

He stayed upright.

“Partner, there’s nothing to forgive.” He wanted to wipe away Yami’s tears, but he knew there was nothing he could do. “It must have been a dream— a really bad nightmare. It’s okay, it’s okay. We’re both okay.”

He pressed a light kiss to the top of his partner’s head, hoping it would help soothe him.</span>

The kiss made him feel warm. But that warmth conflicted with the fear that had taken his heart. Was his protection...trapping? Was he keeping Yugi tethered to a life he never wanted?

<em>&quot;What...what do you...do about...nightmares?&quot;</em> He looked up at him, a slight sway still in his stance. The moon&#39;s rays cast on Yugi&#39;s face, making him look like...an angel. So sweet and pure.</span>

You told me nothing like my nightmare would ever happen, and didn’t stop until I felt like I could believe it.” He laughed awkwardly. “It still…gets to me, once in a while. It doesn’t go away instantly. But I take a lot of comfort in reality. Having you by my side, in my arms, it helps a lot.”

He looked away. “I don’t know that I can provide the same comfort for you, but…but I can try, if it would help. I’m not going anywhere, not unless you want me to.”</span>

He wished he felt comfortable with them retreating into their shared space. But he worried too much if he returned there, he would look like a monster. 

Instead, he backed up from Yugi, and a deck of cards appeared in his hands. He shuffled them aimlessly. No, he didn&#39;t want to play a game. It was a nervous habit he had gotten into. 

<em>&quot;I am sorry,&quot;</em> He said, finally a bit more composed. A tear or two fell, but he had gotten himself together. <em>&quot;May we sit on the bed...together?&quot;</em>

He was awkwardly asking for affection- hence the cards, shuffling one after another, trying to use them to give him courage.</span>

It must have been a terrible nightmare, to shake Yami up this bad. The best he could figure out was that Yami had nearly given him a penalty game, but the rest of it he had no idea for. 

“Of course.” Yugi walked back to the bed, sat down, and patted the spot next to him with his hand. “There’s nothing to apologize for, though, partner. Everyone gets nightmares.”</span>

Yami glanced at Yugi. Looked him up and down. There was nothing wrong with him, no signs of pain or anguish. A bit of mild confusion, he noted. He leaned against Yugi, finally. The cards disappeared from his hands. 

<em>&quot;I have never had one before.&quot;</em> Nights were either dreamless, or spent &quot;awake&quot; in some fashion. And rarely, a good dream. Tonight was not one of those rare nights, it seemed. 

<em>&quot;We were in the room of my heart. It was a maze, full of traps. I was trying to reach you. I got injured...&quot;</em>

His hand came to his shoulder, then. No cuts, not even a sign of hurt. 

<em>&quot;I became a monster. You grew afraid of me, you ran away. When you didn&#39;t listen...didn&#39;t follow some arbitrary &#39;rules&#39;...&quot;</em> Yami didn&#39;t want to say it again. Now he fussed with his hands, not meeting Yugi&#39;s gaze. The real problem was that it felt so plausible. That he had fallen back into what everyone had said about him- that he was a demon attached to Yugi. 

<em>&quot;I lost you.&quot;</em> He mumbled. <em>&quot;It is my greatest fear, to lose my better half.&quot;</em></span>

He listened carefully to the whole explanation. He could understand why it scared him so much; he could still remember being scared of Yami, and he remembered his own nightmare, with his own penalty game. Yugi’s own nightmare had felt so real. So, for his partner…

He squeezed Yami’s shoulder lightly.

“You’re not gonna lose me,” Yugi promised. “Not now, not ever. Even if you turn into a monster, I’m not leaving you. I’m not afraid of you anymore, and I never will be again. You aren’t going to lose me.”

With a sigh, he added, “I’m not your better half. That’s not how partnerships work. We’re equals, we balance each other out.”

One thing, however, was very interesting. Yugi didn’t give voice to it, but it was odd he had been in the room in Yami’s heart. Yugi had never been there before. It was a sacred place that belonged to his partner. He’d only ever been to his own room, messy and filled with childish things. He didn’t give voice to it, but he had no idea what his dream self had been up to.</span>

He could argue for days about how he felt Yugi was his better half, how he would have been lost to some great darkness without him...

But Yugi was right. Yami turned and took his face in his hands. <em>&quot;Partner...Yugi.&quot;</em> He looked serious, albeit very tired, and a bit snotty. 

<em>&quot;I do not care if I was a King. I do not want to be one, if it does not mean you are my prince, at my side. The only memories I desire are the ones we make together.&quot;</em>

He pressed their foreheads together. <em>&quot;Do you understand, partner? My eternal life, my memory- it is yours. I would never let you go, and I never want to drive you away.&quot;</em> 

The urge to pull them into themselves rose again. How could he possibly understand his ferocity while he was only a vision? And a poor looking one at that.</span>

“My memories and eternal life, they’re yours, too. You’ll never drive me away. We’ll never stop making memories together.”

He couldn’t stop a smile from forming on his face. “If you really are a king, then I’ll be at your side. I’ll be your prince. Always.”

It didn’t matter how tired or snotty his partner looked. This was the person he loved, who he would love for every day for the rest of time. To him, there was no one more handsome, no one more wonderful.</span>

Yami would maintain it if it meant they could simply be together, even if it was only brief and bright. And it was bright, warm. There was no cold place full of stairs and mazes and terror- it fact, it just mimicked Yugi&#39;s bedroom. There were some irregularities- the window didn&#39;t reflect the rest of Domino, the bed was...larger? And it seemed to have some sort of luxury sheets on it. They both were seated on it just the same, but now they felt physical, real. And now Yugi could see his emotions more clearly. 

<em>&quot;My prince,&quot;</em> He said softly, as if to test it out. He smiled. <em>&quot;You are befitting of a prince...You have the eyes of one...The beauty of one.&quot;</em>

He pulled Yugi down, to lay beside him. <em>&quot;...May we stay here? Like this, together. My prince must...dispell my nightmares.&quot;</em>

He had to have some sort of control- and this was his way of expressing it. But in truth, his eyes showed how he was tired, and all he wanted was...comfort.</span>

Yugi’s face turned red. Did he deserve the title, to be Yami’s prince? Was he really that beautiful? But when they were like this, it didn’t matter. Yami had already decided, and it was Yami’s choice, not Yugi’s.

Laying down next to him, he reached out to grab his partner’s hands. 

“W-we can stay here together as long as you like… I’ll dispel your nightmares… My king.”

Upon saying the last two words, his face got even redder. It had slipped out, he wasn’t even sure that was okay to say… Embarrassed, Yugi stared at his hands.</span>

He moved his hand to run through the back of Yugi&#39;s hair. He hummed. Blankets loosely tangled around their legs. <em>&quot;And what would my prince want?&quot;</em> 

This teasing was comfortable. It helped him feel a bit more in control, grounded in some reality. The reality where all is well- he and Yugi are together. Not separated by some terrible force, some terrible monster.</span>

When they parted, he sighed. <em>&quot;What day is it tomorrow, partner?&quot;</em> He asked it somewhat wistfully. <em>&quot;I fear I may not let you rest...But if it is a school night...&quot;</em></span>

Oh! Something came to mind…

“Remember when you had that dream about us dating? You said you got me a gift, right? Could I see it?”

It was the only thing he could think of. Perhaps seeing it here would be like Yami was giving him the gift for real.</span>
