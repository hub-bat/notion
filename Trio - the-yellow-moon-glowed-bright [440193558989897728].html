&quot;It will take a minute to get used to the rhythm, but I&#39;ll take care of everything. We&#39;ll just trot around the lake. Make sure you let me know if you want to stop.&quot; This assurance was being repeated for maybe the fifth time in as many hours. 

&quot;She&#39;s very nice. We&#39;ll meet her first.&quot; He calmly extended a hand to the mare, letting her investigate. She pressed her nose to him, begging for a treat. He pulled a peppermint candy from his pocket and offered it. &quot;She&#39;s got the same taste as you. Here, you try?&quot;</span>

But Enzan was so excited for this. He had mentioned the horses almost every time their vacation was brought up.

Plus, Laika felt like he was required to be excited too, because of what he had started this vacation out with. He wanted to ride horses too, of course, but he wasn&#39;t really feeling good.

&quot;{She&#39;s pretty...}&quot; Laika signed before taking the mint. He held it up in offering to the horse, and looked to Enzan for confirmation. Like this, right?</span>

&quot;Try petting her nose, she likes it.&quot; He moved to the side to check her reigns were all fastened correctly, and her saddle was tight enough. Horses loved to inhale and hold their breath wide so the saddle would be loose and their riders would sway too much side to side.

She pressed her head against Laika a bit more, taking a liking to him. She nuzzled up to his chest, bumping her huge head against him.</span>

Hesitantly, he petted her nose, and the middle of her head as well. She was warm and furry... it was a nice sensation. It helped to make him relax and smile.

Animals were always so good. He really enjoyed them.</span>

However, he teetered slightly afterwards. The sudden change in height and his lightheadedness were a bad combo. But still... this was <em>way</em> higher than he expected!

Laika kept back as Enzan joined him. Almost instantly his arms wrapped around the other to stay steady.

Looking around was the real treat though. Just being a few feet higher changed the view dramatically. He got a better view of the pond, a fuller view of it. This was all so nice.</span>

He looked out at the scenery more, noting the flora around the pond. What could he say about it that he already had? It was all pretty, and ideal to his temperament.

&quot;{Is she older? I heard those were the best to use for kids. Most patient.}&quot; Laika&#39;s hands moved slow. He had to focus on them to make sure he was saying the right thing.</span>

They were about halfway around the small body of water, and entered a canopy of trees a little to the right of the bank. It crossed over a small wooden bridge, up and down. Enzan pulled the horse to a stop there, and leaned his head back to look at Laika.

Laika looked down at him, smile genuine. He brushed aside a few strands of Enzan&#39;s bangs, and placed a quick kiss on his forehead.

&quot;{I love you.}&quot; In the short form. He held the sign as his hand met Enzan&#39;s heart. At least the redness in his cheeks was appropriate for the moment.</span>

As they moved again, Laika stayed leaned over. It helped with the dizzyness, especially when he rested his head on Enzan&#39;s shoulder. The world was still when it was like this.</span>

The warmth of Laika&#39;s cheek pressed through Enzan&#39;s shirt. It was nice to be close, but he was worried. 

&quot;Almost there...&quot; he mumbled. &quot;I can have her bring us a bit closer to the house.&quot;</span>

He tightened his arms around Enzan as his eyes took in the landscape. They were barely opened, causing everything to be seen through an impressionist&#39;s lense. It was beautiful, the most green he had seen in a long time.</span>

Enzan leaned back and he pulled her to a stop. She stepped back to adjust, and centered herself in front of the stairs into the house.

He got up on the first few steps and worked his arm under Laika&#39;s stomach. &quot;Laika... wake up just for a second...&quot; worry fluttered in his chest, but the feeling of his steady breathing was reassuring.</span>

The question made Laika looked up. His hands waved slow.

&quot;{Yes, for now. Probably just a stomach virus.}&quot;

It was rare that it felt this bad, and that could be a problem. Times like this where a perfect opportunity for other problems. It had already happened once, the first day. Laika really didn&#39;t want to--

He wasn&#39;t the best cook, but everything had been safe. Blues was double checking the whole time...

Whatever caused it... I&#39;ll help.&quot; The looking around was concerning, but he didn&#39;t let go just yet. He would take the risk of Laika getting sick on them both.</span>

This wasn&#39;t what he wanted, not at all. He could feel two gazes instead of the one. Laika wasn&#39;t sure he could juggle the three. This fever was bad, usually his body didn&#39;t go into overtime like this.

The Other hummed, waiting for an answer. Laika gave then anothee passing glance as he was held.

&quot;{I&#39;m don&#39;t think it was anything we ate.}&quot; He sloppily reassured. &quot;{Maybe something in the water. It&#39;s different than home.}&quot;

Enzan nodded and started to shift under Laika as he spoke of food. His exact worries voiced. It was a tad calming, but the fact that they&#39;d both thought of it made it too real. 

&quot;I&#39;ll have water brought in from the store then.&quot; He started to lay Laika on the bed, shifting the covers over him to stave off the chills.</span>

Laika winced.

&quot;{I&#39;m sorry.}&quot; He motioned. Leaving Enzan&#39;s embrace was the last thing he wanted right now. But it was a nessecary. Laika at least made sure Enzan didn&#39;t hide his hands under the covers. 

The Other shifted with him, staying on his legs. As Enzan looked away, Laika shot them a look. Why now, why couldn&#39;t they wait until Enzan was gone?

&quot;I am going to get you a bin. Blues is ordering a bunch of purified water for the rest of our trip.&quot; A beep of confirmation from his PET accented the point.

Laika looked back to his intruder. The same pained face stayed. Maybe the purified water would help prevent other stomach bugs, and keep his sickness to a minimum. But it would flush out the other problem.

The Other blinked, looking shocked. Laughter bubbled up.

&quot;That...and that... ok. Blues, have them deliver some medication too. See what Laika is allowed to have.&quot; 

&quot;Yessir.&quot; 

With Blues&#39; help, this wouldn&#39;t be too bad. Enzan carried his supplies back to the room and quietly shouldered the door open, in case Laika had drifted off already.</span>

Laika gripped the sheets as he now faced a mirror of himself. They had their hands on him, gripping his shirt and over his neck. He was done with this, he really didn&#39;t want to face this right now. His pain mixed with anger as he lifted his hands, and gripped The Other back.

&quot;GO AWay!&quot; His voice fizzled out halfway through, but intention was clear. 

Laika shoved forward, just as Enzan nudged open the door. The movement made him freeze. Regret was instant. They laughed and laughed until they vanished.</span>

&quot;Lai-laika?&quot; All of that rushing about to help was frozen. Hurt punctured his lungs and even his small question was muted. Why? What was wrong with him? Was he really being turned away right now, or was it the fever talking? He wanted to ask, but what if it wasn&#39;t him? <s>What if it was the <em>monster?</em></s>

The yell had disturbed the shaky balance of his body. He squeezed his eyes shut in hopes to quell it, but still Laika looked green in the face.</span>

&quot;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s gonna be okay.&quot; He grabbed the washcloth from the bin and offered it as the first protective measure. He multitasked, bin carefully held in one hand and the two temperature regulators set aside so he could brush Laika&#39;s hair away from his face. &quot;Breath, breath.&quot; 

He sat close, doing all the moving for him. Whether he puked or not, Enzan was a hovering mass of comfort.</span>

A fist stayed on his chest, and it rubbed in a circle over and over and over. &quot;{Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.}&quot;

This had gone downhill so fast. Laika found himself caught up in it. He tried to breathe, though it was mostly gasps.</span>

&quot;Hey, hey. It&#39;s okay.&quot; He reached out very gently to still Laika&#39;s hands. His touch was like a summer breeze to avoid coming off like he was restricting him. &quot;You&#39;re forgiven. Just try and relax. Breath... breath. In...and out... slow down, you&#39;ll get there.&quot; 

It was a challenge to keep his voice steady and slow when he was thrumming with nerves. He was fairly confident now it was part of the sickness that had him acting strangely. If not... explanations could come later.</span>

His chest started to ease from a restriction he didn&#39;t realize had happened. Soon he could sigh, and hold Enzan&#39;s hand. Coming down was easier than expected. Probably because of the sickness.

His eyes opened halfway, to set sights on Enzan. Laika&#39;s other hand wiped his eyes free of the tears. There were just a few, though the rest were probably on their way.</span>

A few moments passed before Blues nudged the door open and carried in a pair of cups of juice. &quot;The water and medication will be here in seven minutes and twenty three seconds according to available data.&quot; 

He offered the first cup to Enzan, who didn&#39;t take it right away. The unspoken command made him instead, move to prop Laika up. &quot;Is this alright, sir?&quot; For every small touch he examined Laika&#39;s face to make sure his reactions weren&#39;t pained. Once Laika was upright, he took the cup again and offered it.</span>

Blues waited patiently for them to finish their drinks before taking the cups from them and helping Laika back down. 

&quot;I will put the horse away as well, Enzan-sama. Before the delivery arrives.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you Blues. Take care of it.&quot; 

Blues bowed a little and left the room again. Enzan breathed. &quot;I&#39;ve got an ice pack here too, if you want.&quot; He picked it up and placed it on the bed where Laika could reach.

His bustling came to a standstill. He&#39;d done what he could for now. Blues could handle the rest. Enzan simply waited expectantly for Laika to spell out whatever he needed.</span>

Maybe he should say it sooner rather than later. Or should he wait for Blues to come back? The urgency remained even though his body lagged.

Blues did return shortly, toting an office-type water cooler. He set it down beside the bed, and looked at Enzan for confirmation. Enzan nodded, so Blues took a stack of paper cups from under his arm and set them with it, and then a bottle of low dosage medicine was set on the bedside table. 

&quot;Is that all sir? Do you need anything else?&quot; For good measure, he filled a cup while he spoke. It was set beside the medicine.</span>

The moment of rest ended with Blues&#39; return. Laika sat himself up a little, surprised that they got something so... big. He was just expecting the gallon bottles, not something like this. It would be a feat if he went through all that water himself.

Laika waved his hands, &quot;{No, that&#39;s all.}&quot;

But then he paused, and looked at the cup.

&quot;{Actually, it would be best if you stayed Blues. I need to say this now. For health&#39;s sake.}&quot;</span>

Then again, he might not even fit in this room very well. His hologram might suffice.

Curiosity and worry muted Enzan, so he just remained a comforting presence at Laika&#39;s side. <em>&quot;Health&#39;s sake&quot;</em> so he had to brace himself for knowing more symptoms or problems. 

&quot;Take your time,&quot; he finally urged, &quot;you have our attention.&quot;</span>

Search showed up seconds later, as a hologram. &quot;<em>Yes, sir.</em>&quot;

&quot;{I have to say something. It would be best if you all knew now.}&quot;

Laika sighed and looked up for a second.

&quot;Jцšт spїт їт оцт.&quot; 

He squinted. 

&quot;{Earlier... something was bothering me. It happens more when I&#39;m sick, or not feeling well in mind. It&#39;s been since I came to at the hospital.}&quot;

He let that settle, and his hands rest. Slowly his hands rose back up.

&quot;{They don&#39;t have the power to take over, but The Other is still here. I worried about telling. I know they cause us all too much pain. But I don&#39;t want to keep secrets like that from you. It hurts.}&quot;</span>

He wasn&#39;t afraid, now. But... but. Tension still rang in his ears.

&quot;I... <em>we</em>...&quot; Enzan looked to Blues for help. &quot;I mean... you have... spoken in your sleep before. Just, one time. You were stressed. I was-- <em>we</em> were hoping it wasn&#39;t... that.&quot; He didn&#39;t want to describe the encounter. 

&quot;I am glad you told us.&quot; Blues helped, &quot;it is important we be transparent about such things. I am sorry to hear it is not fully flushed out. How do you know it is still there?&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about telling me things.&quot; Enzan supplied, &quot;it&#39;s best when we trust each other completely.&quot; Both of these secrets together was...a lot. The combination did not seem... safe.</span>

Laika looked away and thought back, trying to think of any time past that initial wake up that he tried to speak. Attempts at it during therapies weren&#39;t considered. Even still, it was too long of a time. He couldn&#39;t pin point anything.

For a moment, his hands didn&#39;t move. A flurry of new thoughts rushed through as he tried to remember again. Earlier, earlier... what happened in the early months that could have made him nervous enough-- anxious enough-- for The Other to take over? A test? The first rounds of physical therapy? The surgeries? Family leaving? What? <em>What was it?!</em>

His shoulders sunk as it hit. The reporter. 

&quot;Dїиg-dїиg-dїиg!!!&quot;

Laika&#39;s hands flew up. &quot;{That wasn&#39;t a normal sleep, I don&#39;t think. I can&#39;t remember... but they couldn&#39;t move,  they didn&#39;t have the power. Just... my voice.}&quot;

He realized he wasn&#39;t making sense. It was probable that Enzan just thought this was fever.

&quot;<em>It was not.</em>&quot; Searchman informed. &quot;<em>You were in a trance, due to the stress of the situation. It was what we thought might calm you down quickest.</em>&quot;</span>

Blues nodded along, &quot;it is just important... how does it manifest itself now?&quot; Depending on how residual it was, maybe he had some similar experiance to compare and help with.

Laika relaxed a little at that. For a moment was deeply worried that The Other had somehow gained control of him while he slept normally. He was relieved to hear that was not the case. But it was painful to see Enzan get so tense. This was the second time now... 

&quot;{They are a version of me. A child.}&quot; Laika&#39;s hands tried to stay calm, but the situation was catching up to him. &quot;{They grow in age the worse I feel. When I am well, they are not around.}&quot;

He laid back, and put the ice pack back on his head. It was even cooler than before, which made him worry about his temperature rising. His arms stayed still for a moment. It was starting to really hurt to see Enzan upset. Laika&#39;s chest was tight.

&quot;<em>I was asked to refrain from informing you until Laika could. I had spotted him interacting with nothing a few other times, which lead to my prior knowledge.</em>&quot; 

Searchman&#39;s hologram bowed in apology. 

&quot;<em>We do not know why it has stuck around for so long. Most drugs clear the system within a few months after stoppage. However, whatever brought this has decided to stay longer.</em>&quot;</span>

This was real, they were here, Laika was the one before them. Blues was the one holding his back. No one else, nothing else. He took a long deep gulp of air and closed his eyes. Just for a moment.

&quot;We should inform the doctors. We need to know as much as we can about this.&quot; Blues rubbed Enzan&#39;s back as he spoke. God forbid it happened again in the future and they needed that information. 

Enzan nodded. He steadied under Blues&#39; hand.  &quot;We will get you all the proper care you need. I don&#39;t... you shouldn&#39;t have to listen to it alone. Tell me what it says... I&#39;ll help you refute it.&quot;</span>

Laika nodded slow, and his hands rose up again. Now that this had been told, he was more relaxed. It was just Enzan&#39;s reaction that worried him now. Laika wanted him to be back to calm too. 

&quot;{They are saying nothing now.}&quot; Laika glanced over to a decorative wooden stool on the far side of the room. Far away from where the rest had gathered. The Other was there, looking towards Enzan. &quot;{In a while, they&#39;ll go away. The relief of telling you has them calm.}&quot;</span>

Blues widened the circle of comfort on Enzan&#39;s back. 

&quot;So... we&#39;ll just... help you through anything tough, and it won&#39;t harm you...&quot; the fact that there was <em>some</em> way to prevent it was good. In spite of everything, they could still have control over some emotions. &quot;Communication will help--&quot;</span>

&quot;{I don&#39;t think they can physically harm me anymore. It is just a matter of keeping a strong will.}&quot; 

And not letting himself be entranced. That felt like such a impossible danger. Now he understand why Enzan never offered it as an option since that one time. 

Communication though, just how much should he communicate? The Other made plenty of small comments, though most never bothered Laika. Enzan, Blues and Search probably only needed to worry about the ones that got under his skin. The ones that tempted him to react. 

&quot;{Thank you, for letting me explain.}&quot; Laika breathed. &quot;{Now that it&#39;s out... I&#39;m tired. Warm. Medicine?}&quot;</span>

He should be mad the secret was kept so long, or scared more, or something... but he felt more in control. With Blues here, and the phantom pointed out... they could handle it. Any of Laika&#39;s symptoms, Enzan would help him bare. 

&quot;Thank you for telling us.&quot; 

Blues picked up the medicine and grabbed the cup of water. He placed the cup in Laika&#39;s hands as he opened the package. &quot;Here you are sir... one or two should help ease the fever...&quot; he handed him one and set the second aside to take if he needed more.</span>

&quot;{That&#39;s all the surprises. I think. I don&#39;t have anymore.}&quot; He waved as he settled back down into the pillow. &quot;{No... proposals or anything... sorry.}&quot;

He grinned a little. Suddenly he was exhausted, much like how he felt on the horse. It all hit him at once again. He fought with his eyes to see Enzan&#39;s reaction. They wanted to close on him.</span>

He didn&#39;t say anything more, but kept his smile as Enzan came closer. Sleep was an easy order to fulfill, especially with Enzan ensuring that he got there. His slender hand came up and met the arm that Enzan had put over him. It was a good weight that helped ease out the last of the tension his chest had accumulated. 

There was one more gesture made before Laika started to drift off. His usual sign off to Enzan, a familiar sign with thumb, index, and pinky extended.</span>
