Enzan wheeled out his chair and folded up his cheaters. Two cups of coffee were already sitting empty on his desk, and only Enzan knew how many times he had refilled. 

&quot;Sit down. Show me.&quot; He was all business. His old coldness crept up whenever Firebird&#39;s business came into the house. A shield, to defend against the hints of lingering darkness that kept worming its way out of the ground.</span>

Enzan&#39;s voice snapped him out of it, forcing him to come further into the apartment and settle in. His street persona was shed, all except for the blacked out PET that Firebird used. It was set down on the desk as he took a seat.

God, this felt too close to a time when they were younger. He never thought they&#39;d have this experience again.

A button was pressed on the PET, and a holographic screen showed the prize. Cosmoman, deep in stasis.

&quot;{It was either this or his deletion.}&quot; Laika signed. &quot;{He acknowledged himself that this would be more useful.}&quot;</span>

Seeing Cosmoman helpless before them was a strange feeling. Could they truely have such an asset? Even when they had captured Desertman in the Nebula crisis, Regal had managed to spin things for the worse. 

&quot;Feels like a trap.&quot; He folded his hands into his lap. &quot;We should comb the data for what Regal might have added. His synchro rates have to be artificially created.&quot;</span>

Still, Laika nodded in agreement. He reached out and grabbed the stylus out of the PET. Buttons were pressed simultaneously as he hit options on the screen. It went black as code started to filter in.

As it compiled, Laika&#39;s hands rose again. There wasn&#39;t a spot to tack in a quiet comment to the other Enzan. It wasn&#39;t a feeling he liked, especially when they were at <em>home</em>. This should&#39;ve been taken elsewhere, in hindsight. 

&quot;{I don&#39;t like it. Tried looking at it on sight but some of the lines just didn&#39;t make sense. They seemed redundant or just... gibberish.}&quot;</span>

He leaned in to examine how the PET dealt with displaying foreign text and language. 

&quot;There has to be something he left. That damned man can&#39;t keep his fingers out of anything.&quot; Enzan would know. Clearing Blues and Rockman&#39;s coding took ages. &quot;Search just for something common. Anything in human language or pictures.&quot; 

He reached up, tender and suddenly overwhelmed with curiosity. When Cosmoman&#39;s body wasn&#39;t visibly, he could almost pretend it was a classroom lesson. Something new to learn; Doctor Hikari would faint at the prospect. All this data, never <em>truely</em> seen by current scientists. They would have to keep records of all of it.</span>

Just find the familiar things. Even if that&#39;s all they had to do, there was so much code that took up a navi. Darkloid or not, this could easily be a multi-day venture. He knew from his last go about combing through code. And that was all understood, for the most part.

He watched Enzan&#39;s hand, distracted by the small change. Could it be that easy...?

Suddenly something caught his eye. Laika pointed out as it scrolled. Sudden Kinglish in the sea of alien text. There was tampering like they expected.</span>

Cosmoman is under the impression he couldn&#39;t use it well.&quot; Though, Regal could have coded that thought in. The idea made Enzan&#39;s head spin.

Enzan read through it as quickly as he could. His Kinglish was rusty. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think this is important. A distraction to make this more of a haystack. Maybe a test to see his programming work. Let&#39;s save it in case.&quot; He made the PET tag the spot and moved on. 

&quot;You know what they say about haystacks. Burn the hay to find the needle.&quot; The saying was butchered bitterly.</span>

Laika winced at the rest of Enzan&#39;s words. That was a personal jab, he knew it. It was well deserved though. He had done this to Enzan too many times.

He paused the scroll, and signaled Enzan to look over.

&quot;{We need to split this up. It&#39;ll go faster that way. I can&#39;t read Kinglish fully, but I can spot it.}&quot;</span>

&quot;Here.&quot; He flipped his own screen and rolled around so they were much closer. Maybe he could make a small repair. This wasn&#39;t Laika&#39;s fault-- they had to fully take care of this before it escalated again. &quot;Just tag everything for now unless it seems very important.&quot; 

Enzan&#39;s arm came up and around Laika&#39;s shoulders. No apology, but this was as close as he could come without a choke. He set his side of the data on a quick scroll so he could lean on Laika and comfortably watch.</span>

The knowledge gained from this was far better than simply deleting an eyesore.

After Enzan settled, Laika reached back and grasped the fingers lingering there. They could do this. This was nothing.

&quot;I&#39;ll start- from the bottom. Meet you halfway.&quot; He whispered.</span>

About a quarter of the way through his half, his eyes were starting to burn. He powered through like he had many times before, but it only got worse. About halfway through, he nodded off. 

He jerked himself awake and sat up. A short clearing of the throat broke the silence, and he reached to pause his side&#39;s scrolling.</span>

It hurt. It hurt like hell. Not because of what he was doing to himself, but how they kept speaking to each other.

Enzan felt the weight of responsibility fall to him. He was the one with the hangups about what Laika was doing, so <em>he</em> had to be active in finding a way to have less of them.

He couldn&#39;t loose this power, what little it was. Cosmoman was a <em>key</em> to unlocking their path to true peace. A time and place were Regal was truly gone.

&quot;{If we hand him over, we lose.}&quot; Laika didn&#39;t choose his words well. He spoke straight from the flames stoking his heart. &quot;{They&#39;ll drag their feet and keep us out if it.

&quot;Every time we have beaten him before. It was as a team. It was by the book. Whenever we are caught alone, he does more damage to us.&quot; He finally looked back at him, pain etched from his eyebrows to chin. &quot;What am I supposed to do if you die?&quot;

He sighed, audibly. &quot;{I understand... I know. We can tell them, that I have no problem with. Just, <em>please.</em> I&#39;m not about to sit by and let them control this. That&#39;s what he wants. Cosmoman has to stay.}&quot;

The tone and statements bugged him deeply though. It stirred anger, but Laika tried to keep that at bay. Surely Enzan realized that this was eating away at his security too! All this news had him on edge, constantly looking over his shoulder.</span>

Okay.&quot; He waved his hand, feeling the mistakes spilling out of him like he was ten years younger. He felt the time slip by, making it impossible to fix. &quot;But I can&#39;t-- we need people in our lane. As many as possible. I&#39;m so--&quot; 

He gritted his teeth, and felt the pain of tears automatically blocked off. 

&quot;I <em>hate</em> this I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m still so hung up on this I <em>trust</em> you I do--&quot; he looked to the ceiling briefly. Some days, it felt like Laika was more put together than <em>him</em> with his systems and networking to take action. Enzan was left behind in the dust, pushing papers. 

&quot;They don&#39;t have to control us. Just. Regulation...&quot; His hands dropped. It sounded so naive once he said it. He needed to believe in something though. Trusting at least a few of his coworkers after <em>everything</em> they had been through kept him sane. 

There was a gentle knock at the wall between the kitchen and the sitting room. Blues stood holding a small pan of pot-pie.</span>

He started to mirror Enzan&#39;s faces, allowing the stress of their situation to crack through the surface. Laika had been trying so hard to wait until <em>after</em>, like a good <em>soldier</em>. But he wasn&#39;t that anymore, and the reminder was like a dagger through the heart.

His head hung. Just as he tried to say more on the matter, Blues knocked them out of focus.

Food. Laika stared at the offered dish, then let his eyes wandered back to Enzan. They were done. Laika stood up, and turned to go to the kitchen.

&quot;{We need to eat. Rest.}&quot; He signed. &quot;{I can&#39;t work anymore. Not today. It&#39;s been a lot.}&quot;</span>

&quot;Okay.&quot; 

He didn&#39;t feel like that resolved it. He didn&#39;t want the last word. He didn&#39;t want to be the loud, irrational one because that would just <em>prove</em> he wasn&#39;t a leader anymore. 

&quot;Too much.&quot; he finally agreed, and walked to loop his arm around the small of Laika&#39;s back. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I raised my voice.&quot; 

Blues set the table, feeling very out of place while wearing Enzan&#39;s pink apron. &quot;If you need anything more sirs, let me know.&quot; 

&quot;And if I may add. I trust you both.&quot; he reached up and patted both of their heads. &quot;Sleep early tonight. Please.&quot; 

Enzan glanced at him, trying for a pointed glare but just looking annoyed.</span>

The pat helped to diffuse the situation further, though Laika blinked at the words Enzan said.

&quot;{You&#39;ll be sleeping too...}&quot; He signed. &quot;{I was... kinda hoping we could talk more then.}&quot;

He didn&#39;t like eating while things were unsteady, let alone try to sleep. Laika sat down at the table anyways, and looked down. Blues had done good, despite their bickering in the background.</span>

He sat down as well, and picked up his fork. 

Blues left them, saving the copyroid&#39;s energy for later if they needed it. 

The pie was just the right tempurature and prepared the ameroupian way. Just how Enzan liked it. He ate slowly, saying nothing.</span>

He wasn&#39;t sure, so he stuck out his hand. An offer to take the plate up for him.</span>

Seeing Enzan near the bedroom was a good sight. On his way over, he stopped by the desk. The black PET screens shut off, and locked. It took less than a second, and Laika was soon standing in the door with his partner.

&quot;It was- enough?&quot; Laika mumbled. He walked in to sit on the edge of the bed. Enzan was welcomed, of course.</span>

Enzan leaned against Laika, trying to convey his care and that he was on his <em>side</em>. 

He was just so fucking scared. 

He wiggled his socks off, and stared down at his feet. He didn&#39;t want to talk more, but they had to. Maybe if Laika layed out more of a plan, he would feel better.</span>

&quot;I-m sorry.&quot; He whispered. A turn to face Enzan revealed true expression. Pain.

&quot;Hi-s control will be heav-ier than Countershade&#39;s, I promise.&quot; Laika explained in a broken voice. His hands held Enzan&#39;s tightly. &quot;He won&#39;t come out of stasis unless we-re absolutely sure he&#39;s been severed.&quot;

&quot;I guess, Firebird. That makes sense.&quot; His fingers curled into Laika&#39;s shirt. The shaking and sobs were starting to reverberate into his body. He&#39;d hoped exhaustion from his previous outburst would keep him calm.

&quot;For now, let&#39;s concentrate on our security, and telling them. Anything else we can put on hold.&quot;</span>

Tomorrow night, or right in the afternoon. Manabe or Pen were easy to catch around that time. Easy to pass information off to. Kifune was lenient with payments too, though that wasn&#39;t a concern this time.

Laika closed his eyes tight and <em>truly</em> focused on breathing. Back to the calm he had before, he begged. It wasn&#39;t coming, even after minutes of struggling to breathe. There was something more on his chest, the heaviest of all the issues.

&quot;Enzan...&quot; Laika whispered. He opened his eyes to find his partner&#39;s. &quot;I- I- had hoped he was gone. That he was rotting. I&#39;m- I want to make sure of it this time. Scared--of how far- I am willing to go-&quot;</span>

Laika repeated the affirmation. He failed to say anything more. The fragility of his throat wouldn&#39;t allow it. It begged him to also stop and breathe.

But the voiced thought felt like a weight on his shoulders. It was scary to admit something so grave, especially given their past experiences with his body wanting blood.

Laika tugged at Enzan, to bid him even closer. He nuzzled, tried to, as he breathed. A closed fist ran across his chest. Apologizes circled over and over.</span>

&quot;Breath. Keep it up. Keep going slow.&quot; He turned to face Laika and wrap both arms around him. 

He hated that he wasn&#39;t surprised. The news of Regal still being after them was scary, but not surprising. Enzan knew he would never feel free of him. Not even if he died. His creations were still there; they didn&#39;t know how many he had. 

&quot;We&#39;ll figure this out together. Whatever happens, I won&#39;t leave your side.&quot;</span>

Too many times they&#39;d gone through this together. Just when he thought the need would stop, Enzan was there again, guiding him through.

The words were comfortable to hear, even if they contradicted what he assumed earlier. A false divide.

Laika was able to take another gasp, easier this time. Easier became more and more common, enough for him to respond and hug Enzan back.</span>

Firebird should&#39;ve only been for the information gathering they were designed for in the first place. Laika shuddered at the thought of how they&#39;ve evolved into this. They, too, were scary now. He wasn&#39;t sure what could happen now if they saw L&#233;izer on the streets.

He was scared like Enzan, scared to go out without the helmet on.

&quot;You- are so brave-&quot; Laika tried to find positive, little things to keep them afloat. &quot;We have to keep- it up. Can&#39;t--let him win.&quot;</span>

His gaze grew delicate, and he reached up to carefully clean Laika&#39;s face as well. &quot;Somehow. I&#39;m going to make us safe.&quot; He whispered, before a fresh batch of warm tears rolled down his face.

The recall made Laika shuddered. Past a year later and everything relating to those hours was still fear inducing. He clinged to Enzan&#39;s shirt, and shook his head.

&quot;I- can&#39;t think. The security we have now should be good... should be.&quot; He hushed. &quot;Just have to t-ell. Pen and Manabe...&quot;</span>

A harder hiccup burned him. &quot;M just. Ugh--&quot; Laika knew. Or if he didn&#39;t, Enzan couldn&#39;t summon the words to explain; how the moment Laika left to go anywhere, Enzan counted the minutes until he was back. 

&quot;Thank you. I- hh. They need to know.&quot; Finding Regal guilty after everything stacked against them was a feat the two of them deserved to know over.</span>

He couldn&#39;t fault Enzan for thinking of such drastic measures. Had his tracker not been touched, things would&#39;ve been different. They wouldn&#39;t even be in this state.

Laika tried to ignore what-ifs. He drew a shaky breath and tried to sit up. They needed to be better situated for bed, so they could at least try to sleep. He tried to pull Enzan up along with him, into the pillows and under the covers.</span>

Enzan reached and guided Laika down until his head rested against Enzan&#39;s chest. His arms wrapped around him, trembling, but representative of the shields Enzan wanted up.</span>

The quiet admittance was paired with Laika&#39;s arms reaching up and setting themselves around Enzan&#39;s back. He took easily to being surrounded by Enzan&#39;s warmth, but the scent that usually calmed him had little effect. All that could be smelt was the bitter notes of coffee, none of it&#39;s roast.

Laika ignored it, pulling himself up a little to be under Enzan&#39;s chin. His jut barely peaked from under the covers.

&quot;I like this, though. The way you&#39;re holding-- me.&quot; He continued, barely even making the effort to whisper.</span>

&quot;Me too. Safe,&quot; he mumbled into Laika&#39;s hair. &quot;You&#39;re safe here.&quot; 

Enzan&#39;s eyes closed. He felt stale peppermint strike his pallet, so he scrunched up tighter. He couldn&#39;t seem to relax with the imagined hard candies triggering memories of death talks. 

He breathed deeper, searching for something else to focus on. His hands slowly flexed back and forth in Laika&#39;s hair.</span>

The passes through his hair were like a switch. Tension in this neck faded, letting his head drop against Enzan&#39;s arm. A sigh was released, as his hands played small circles between Enzan&#39;s shoulders.</span>

Pen woke up late that day. She shuffled from her bed and flopped around the counter until a cup of tea was steeping. Morning nausea had an unusual hold on her, and she wondered if she was getting sick. 

Investigating Marcatto&#39;s sudden illness at the Ijuuin ball was taking up extra time she needed to use for larger missions. The amount of crossfusion she was doing made her feel like more of a workaholic than Enzan.</span>

&gt;Penelope Novella,
&gt;It is my understanding that you are a NetSavior critical to some of the more sensitive NetPolice missions. You serve directly under Manabe and the Commissioner. Your navi is Role, and you both possess powers that go far beyond public knowledge. 
&gt;I am the Firebird. I can be both a blessing and a bringer of doom. My eyes see the future and my feathers record their sights. Such treasures are invaluable to your trade. Your superiors know this.
&gt;This particular knowledge that I now possess is vital to the case that is especially close to your heart. I have seen you work tirelessly over it. Should you wish to accept it on behalf of the NetPolice, come to the location below at 16:21.
&gt;I will require compensation. Kifune is aware. Attempts to trick me will not be tolerated.</span>

Now, however, she was unimpressed. All the public work she had been doing made her a replacement for Enzan. People knew she was around-- most UnderNet work had to stop in the last month. 

Role was, however, interested in the information they might gain. None of their UnderNet contacts had ever wanted an offline meet-up, unless it was a trap. 

&quot;Pen. New email. It&#39;s important.&quot; 

Pen set down her tea and rubbed her face. &quot;Read it to me.&quot; 

Role relayed the entire thing, and Pen slumped over on the table. 

&quot;Hhh... okaaay. Let&#39;s get ready. Let Manabe know where I am. The Firebird has finally come to me. They must have been impressed with how you handled Countershade.&quot;</span>

They idled around a stack of unused crates, staring out at a specific boat as it loomed closer to the docks. It struck a chord with them, like deja vu. This scene had played out for them once before somehow. 

Those who passed near them were merely fishers. No one else would have a purpose to be here. Which is why when Pen would show, they would notice immediately.</span>

Pen nodded, hand hovering near her bo staff while she walked over. The black of firebird&#39;s helmet was spotted, but she kept her eyes peeled even as she approached.

They already had theirs out, and were fiddling with the stylus. Popping it in and out of where it was held. The device was blacked-out, matching its owner.

Firebird spoke more. &quot;Our navis being acquainted makes things easier, surely. I chose you mostly because Manabe seemed to be busy this  afternoon.&quot;

&quot;But, the payment is complete. Business now.&quot; The stood up straight and lifted their head. &quot;This information pertains to the cases concerning Ijuuin Enzan and Laika Biryukov.&quot;</span>

The true business made her eyebrows raise. 

&quot;Mm. I see.&quot; That was a closed case. One she had worked very hard to get that way. They were still finding remnants of the damage that had been done, but most everything about the case had dried up months ago. 

She became acutely aware of how pale she&#39;d gone. Her hand clenched her PET. Firebird was helping the NetPolice. So had Regal, at one point. 

&quot;I&#39;d like to hear as soon as possible. But this area seems a bit. Quiet for that.&quot; Thankfully the fishermen around here seemed to ignore them, but with <em>this</em> case paranoia had aided them more than not.</span>

&quot;The cases were both closed when their assailant was found guilty and sent back to his home country for proper punishment.&quot; They stated as their PET was lifted. Buttons and menus were pressed and tapped as the talked. &quot;And knowing that nation was Nation Z,pst assumed that punishment would be harsh and swift.&quot;

&quot;However, that is not the case it seems.&quot;

A picture was sent through the connection Role had opened. It was security footage of a formal affair. In the middle was a man who stood out. Gaunt features, piercing eyes, and long hair tied in the back.

&quot;That is L&#233;izer, you know of him already. What you do not know is that he is a facade. The human appearance covers copyroid.&quot;

Firebird sent out the next file. An audio clip.

&quot;I assume you have earbuds.&quot;</span>

Perhaps this would tie into the Marcatto case, and bring some sort of closer to that as well. Some days, she&#39;d like to kick her optimism to the curb.

If this was just for the first part of their gift, then the rest would inevitably sit her down. Firebird breathed at the thought, hoping they wouldn&#39;t end up in a similar state. Just stating this fact had made their knees a little weak. 

&quot;A short time ago, we encountered a darkloid who is closely tied to both Leizer and the previously mentioned cases. They were pressed for questions, and gave a variety of answers. This audio is of that interview. It is for the NetPolice to use.&quot;

What followed was a darker voice, deep with the synthetic qualities that most navis held. 

&quot;<em>Leizer? Is that what they are calling themselves? That is... incorrect. That is a recreation of Laserman. Regal recreated them after my failure. They have become Regal&#39;s lapdog... But not with Laserman&#39;s consent. Laserman did not want to continue serving Regal as Nebula did not exist. Regal did not give them a choice... They did not give me a choice.</em>&quot; 

&quot;<em>Funny how &#39;consent&#39; don&#39;t really exist for our kind.</em>&quot; Countershade&#39;s voice chimed in for a moment. 

Firebird&#39;s voice quickly followed. &quot;We strongly suspected that they were not human, and that they had ties to the fugitive. However, the true identity is a small surprise. I was assuming that he had regained control of another Nebula leader.&quot; 

&quot;<em>They are- it is complicated. Regal has... done something to us-- Laserman in particular. One day Laserman was Laserman, and Regal was Regal, but... Now they are the same. Regal uses Laserman as a puppet. It is older technology. P... Pulse transmission.</em>&quot;  

The tracker on the PET&#39;s UI reached it&#39;s end, and the audio clip was finished. Firebird silently watched Pen for any reactions.</span>

This old, sickly man was still the ultimate rival to the Netsaviors. 

&quot;He could be anywhere. Still.&quot; She raised a hand to her mouth, as if thinking. Really, it was to hold in how ill she felt. Pen was sure her face was turning green. She couldn&#39;t show this stranger that. 

&quot;I need a copy of this audio.&quot; She&#39;d never heard this Darkloid, but maybe someone could identify.

&quot;That was within the files transfered, Pen.&quot; Role informed quietly, &quot;I think I have everything.&quot; 

 &quot;How trustworthy is this information, in your opinion?&quot; Her thoughts on Firebird&#39;s identity were tossed away. This mattered so much more.</span>

Firebird tapped on their PET once more, sending over several more shots from the gala discussed beforehand. They were simple more fodder, but they only had L&#233;izer in the crowd. L&#233;izer and another person of interest.

&quot; I believe there is a case involving one named Marcatto. Use these as you see fit.&quot; They informed.

With that, they closed the connection between their PET and Pen&#39;s. It was stowed away in their jacket.
