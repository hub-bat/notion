Oh, just bringing it up again made his chest hurt more. 

Searchman observed the others, before looking down at himself. Just a bowtie, but he was assured over and over that it was plenty. Still... he wasn&#39;t quite sure. A finger prodded his tie as he thought.

He glanced at Search. &quot;Have you ever done this before?&quot; He gestured in the air, then specified, &quot;Like, a party like this?&quot;</span>

Search looked to Rockman. He nodded. &quot;<em>Yes, but military galas in Sharo have been different. Usually navis do not have a gathering space, but rather stay with our operators.</em>&quot; 

He looked out past Blues, observing the space before them all. &quot;<em>It will be a new experience because of that. Though, I worry about being away from Laika, despite him assuring me that he will manage on his own.</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>Ah, Rockman.</em>&quot; Suddenly Searchman was alone. He stood there and watched as his friends disappeared into the chatter. Now he was alone, among navis who probably had no idea who he was, or why he was here. 

He didn&#39;t care for the idea that much, and set out to find Rockman. Otherwise, he had little chance to get pulled into conversation.</span>

It would be a long night, until the dancing started...Why did Blues always have to be so <em>busy-</em> 
&quot;Ah!&quot; He waved his hand, &quot;Search, over here!&quot; 
This would turn embarrassing quick, Rockman realized, if anyone recognized Search and picked him out from any previous battle. &quot;This is my guest,&quot; he hoped that was okay to say, considering he was Enzan&#39;s guest, and by extension he guessed Search was too but- but-

Blues was showing off his new hair system for show. It was much more detailed than anyone else here. 

A couple of young women were already chatting Enzan up. They asked about his clothes, and pressed him to talk about his personal life. Thankfully, it was normal for him to brush things like that off. He smiled at a few of them, but mostly was closed off. 

He looked around for Laika, smiling reassuringly at him when he got a quiet moment.</span>

It was hard with his large boots. They just seemed to seek out the edges of dressed and heels. Search&#39;s position could be tracked by his many muttered apologies. 

Once he got over, he bowed slightly. Being introduced like that made him feel a little special. &quot;<em>Greetings.</em>&quot; 

Laika had been offered a refreshment from a wandering waitress. He accepted the drink, but declined the hors d&#39;oeuvre. Besides that, he had been good at keeping low. With a hand occupied by drink, and Searchman doing his own thing, the less he tried to &#39;talk&#39;, the better. 

Spotting Enzan was easy enough-- and the smiles were returned without delay-- but there was still no sign of the elder Ijuuin. Laika at least wanted him to show up, so that he could settle into a rhythm.</span>

The colors on it made a pleasant spiral through the air. Anyone that saw it would be instantly calmed, but no one was paying her much attention yet. It was more of an idle movement than to accomplish anything. 

Soft music began to play in both sections of the party, and immediately the most bold young woman linked her arm with Enzan&#39;s. A navi of a different operator did the same to Blues. Most of the navis and humans cleared the dance floor to watch the Ijuuin&#39;s waltz. They were very graceful, but showed restraint in keeping the dance very simple. 

Shuuseki had materialized at an elevated area in the room. He was looking over the auction items with a few other stiff rich people.

It was almost inspiring the way he could just appear and vanish, as if his great wealth had bought him superpowers. 

The tap on his shoulder interrupted Laika taking a sip of his drink. He turned immediately, and did his best to hide annoyance. He watched the young man bow, and just looked at him with a eyebrow raised in question.</span>

{It&#39;s good to see another of Enzan&#39;s friends here.} His technique was sloppy, but certainly understandable. {May I have this dance until he becomes available?} The young man&#39;s eyebrows raise in innocent curiosity as his hands stilled. 

Blues spared glances towards Rock and Search through the dance, since his partner could not see his eyes. He smiled faintly, and that encouraged them to latch on even tighter. 

The fans were starting to break up into pairs now, and Tif saw her chance. She got closer to Search and Rock, until she heard his suggestion. She rolled her eyes and once again kept her distance.</span>

As Rock spoked up, he looked down. &quot;<em>Yes but-- I am not sure how.</em>&quot; 

Laika&#39;s expression died, showing no surprise that the other could sign. How did he know that he was mute? Laika couldn&#39;t recall ever seeing this guy before. He didn&#39;t figure Enzan to tell anyone either, though it wasn&#39;t completely impossible. He didn&#39;t have the energy to allow much speculation. Just had to go with the flow. 

He finished what was left in his drink and set it aside so that he could sign. 

&quot;{Usually if one wants to dance, they introduce themselves first.}&quot; Laika moved his hands fast, on purpose.</span>

{My name is Marcatto. I sure Enzan has mentioned me. We work together always.} His words were deteriorating a little as they spoke, but he was trying. {The next song, maybe?

&quot;{I&#39;m Laika. Though I&#39;m sure you already know that.}&quot; He slowed up, and added his name sign in for Marcatto&#39;s future reference. &quot;{And you can talk. I won&#39;t be offended.}&quot;

He glanced past the thumb, and saw the women. Enzan would be exhausted by the time it became their turn to dance. Maybe a warm-up couldn&#39;t hurt.

We&#39;re both so close with Enzan after all.&quot; He held Laika&#39;s hand just a little too tight, but was gracious in all other appearances. His feet were graceful and his smile light as anyone else around them. 

Enzan became very distracted from his own partner when he saw the two men together. 

Blues was looking to take a short break when the first song ended, but he knew that was too good to be true. Tif pushed aside the next hopeful in line and grabbed his hands. &quot;Bluuuues~ So good to see you again.&quot;</span>

The next time he stepped, he made sure to close the somewhat artificial gap they had, adjusting his arms just so to allow it. This was...Nice. His eyes flicked to the side and he saw the death grip Tif had on Blues. He made a face, and looked back up at Search.

Searchman glanced over as they stepped around, spotting who Rockman was talking about. She did seem rather... clingy. 

&quot;<em>Do we need to intervene?</em>&quot; Searchman asked, quietly. 

Laika&#39;s stare became pointed at the mention of Pride. It&#39;d been so long since they last saw each other. Suddenly she was back in his head, as real and as beautiful the last time they said goodbye. It was cruel, it felt like he had just tucked all that away. Just the way he worded it brought it all back.

He looked away as they spun, intensely focused but otherwise blank. Enzan, where was Enzan? He had to get a look at the other. But there, mid-spin, he thought he saw someone else. Someone that made him choke and stumble out of step. 

He weakly pulled away from Marcatto&#39;s hold, but it wasn&#39;t strong enough to succeed. Who was that he just saw? With Enzan? He begged that his mind was just playing tricks again. It couldn&#39;t be him. Couldn&#39;t. Couldn&#39;t. Laika had made <em>sure</em>.</span>

&quot;If we do that, you&#39;ll owe me another dance, Search~&quot; He laughed a little. &quot;Blues can show you much better than me.&quot;

They smiled. &quot;I&#39;m not sure whether to be offended or flattered by that.&quot; 
They swayed one way and that, and the smile was maintained. Finally lights, dim and flittering passed over their features. Dark skinned and very...featureless. They wore an all black coat, adorned with soft blue accents. A hat atop their head. 
&quot;They call me L&#233;izer. I encourage you to do the same.&quot; As if they could feel the burning, iciness of eyes on them, they spun so their back remained to majority of the crowd. &quot;You look as if you&#39;ve seen a <em>ghost,</em> Mister Ijuuin.&quot;</span>

&quot;What brought you over? Usually my father&#39;s guests have something to discuss when they dance.&quot; 

&quot;<em>Hey</em> there, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Marcatto pressed. He didn&#39;t release Laika&#39;s hand just yet. The original exclamation was a little harsh, but he was very fast to pull back. &quot;The song isn&#39;t even over. We won&#39;t be able to cut in yet.&quot;</span>

He adjusted back into step, and shook his head, ignoring how tactless Marcatto&#39;s worry was. Nothing. It was nothing. Yet he worried. It was such a quick glance, but Enzan looked tense. 

Searchman shrugged. &quot;<em>Another dance seems fine. You deserve to dance with Blues.</em>&quot;

He wondered if Blues would ask him too, just out of curiosity. It would be nice, but he wouldn&#39;t push it. Right now he would figure out how to hand Rock over, and also avoid a dance from Tif.</span>

&quot;<em>Aah... I would intrude on his queue though.</em>&quot; Search looked at the line of navis waiting for their chance to dance. &quot;<em>That would be rude, would it not?</em>&quot;

The inching closer just felt uncomfortable. Laika tried to keep his distance through the step of the dance, but just wasn&#39;t that good on his toes. 

He knew Marcatto was gripping his hands on purpose, so that he could get away with all this and just yammer on about his own wants. But that wouldn&#39;t stop Laika from having his usual remarks. Disgust played out across his face, obviously hoping that this song would be over soon.</span>

Despite being in his element, this person made him feel small. 

The song ended and there was a brief pause between songs. Marcatto finally released Laika and bowed to him again.

To be honest with himself, he felt assaulted. Of course, it wasn&#39;t anything like that, but Laika had a reason to deeply dislike Marcatto. It was the way he spoke, and so easily shoved him into something submissive. They had never met, but Laika felt as if Marcatto despised him. 

Instead of harping on that, Laika turned his attention to the man that gave him a real scare. He watched as Enzan ended his dance too, and watched the man walk off as some <em>girl</em> took their place. He was obviously not who Laika thought he was. Why did his brain have to fill in the blank like that? It was the last thing he needed to feel tonight. And... Pride... 

He mentally kicked himself, and tried to distract with a nearby hors d&#39;oeuvre.
Augh, too much saurkraut.</span>

The girl complained only a little, and hovered behind him as he made his way to the tables. Maybe he was a little more shaken up than he&#39;d allowed himself to admit, because that man was still making his hands shake. 

He grabbed some water and tried to casually edge up beside Laika. 

&quot;Sorry you had to deal with him. I told you he was a nuisance.&quot; He mumbled into his cup so hopefully only Laika could hear. 

Unfortunately, Tif did not let go when the song ended, but instead chose to touch Blues&#39; hair and admire it like others had been doing previously. She wrapped her fingers up in it. 

&quot;I would looove something like this for my baton. You know? Like streamers or that shimmery effect?&quot; 

Blues simply hummed out answers until the next song started and she grabbed his hands up again.</span>

It was then the song ended, and he hadn&#39;t <em>really</em> intended to step away from Searchman yet (he was just having so much fun, this was so much like the first time he went to a party with Blues), but he saw Tif <em>touching</em> his hair and the look of...ugh!
&quot;Or, uh, I will.&quot;
He rather aggressively dragged Searchman over, and drove his arm between Tif and Blues. &quot;I&#39;m not sorry.&quot; He said, simply, smiling so very sweetly as he cut in between them, passing Search to Blues and taking Tif along. 
&quot;Good evening.&quot; He said, and smiled at her. He would be, at least mostly, polite.</span>

Searchman sort of dwarfed him... he couldn&#39;t imagine how Rockman had felt. <em>Warm, probably</em>. 

&quot;Evening,&quot; Tif murmured with a smile. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to see you again Rockman.&quot; They both knew this was a lie, but she certainly kept up illusions. &quot;This is the first time we&#39;ve danced I think?

&quot;{He was much more than a nuisance.}&quot; Laika&#39;s hands waved low. &quot;{But he&#39;s gone now, so it&#39;s fine. You seemed stiff when that man appeared. Someone your father knows?}&quot;

&quot;<em>Ah, wait-- Rockman--</em>&quot; Searchman was passed off, just like that. He looked awkward, panicked even. Why did he feel the need to apologize? There was a spark of jealousy on Rockman&#39;s face just as they turned away. And Search wasn&#39;t what Blues expected, probably. This situation was making him second guess! 

However, Blues&#39; reaction seemed to settle all that. The lean into a dance felt more natural, and Blues was allowed to lead.

&quot;<em>Your teachings for Laika did not rub off on me. I apologize if my dance skills are poor.</em>&quot; Searchman admitted, lowly.</span>

&quot;It is okay.&quot; Blues assured, leading wide steps of dance. He liked Searchman as a partner <em>very</em> much. He cleared a space for them so other navis didn&#39;t get stepped on. 

Tif didn&#39;t react to the toe stepping. Those kind of small things didn&#39;t matter. She was only a little taller than Rockman, and she took full advantage to stare down her nose at him.

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan nodded, playing with the cup in his hand and spitefully taking too long. &quot;Weird right? Seems like a waste of money when they have their own section.&quot; He glanced over to the young woman waiting and rolled his shoulders. He avoided eye contact. &quot;Er... I&#39;ll just find you for... the next one. I&#39;m definitely saving the <em>slow</em> dances for you. Fortunately, I know when those will be.&quot; He smiled a little and raised his glass in a mock toast before setting it down. 

This small break was easily helping to replenish his energy reserves. He made a face very quickly, seeking sympathy for needing to take a woman&#39;s arms again. 

&quot;You aren&#39;t doing so bad yourself.&quot; Blues mumbled, &quot;I&#39;ll have to thank Rock for giving me this opportunity.&quot; Blues was a bit more into it with Searchman, and a bit lighter on his feet. He showed off a few dips and spins without pressuring Searchman to do the same. With the other navis he had only given the basic steps.

It was nice to settle and just lean close again once those were over with. &quot;Do you like this type of music? I find it calming.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Laika had a silent chuckle at that. The small interaction with Enzan had helped to relieve some of his anxiety. It was like a check-up, but with more frill than a doctors office should ever have.

When Enzan looked back, all Laika could manage was a shrug, as if he couldn&#39;t understand why the other despised the company of these women. Hopefully he could catch Laika&#39;s mute sarcasm. 

Once Enzan was off dancing, Laika looked to move as well. It was off to a new corner, and to check Shuuseki&#39;s movements along the way.

It felt strange to Search to be dipped back when he was the taller of the two. He was concerned that Blues would stumble and fall, but there was a surprisingly good amount of strength executed along with the moves.

&quot;<em>I do not have any strong feelings about it.</em>&quot; He admitted, and tried to copy a dip Blues had done before. Mirroring was a good skill of his. &quot;<em>However, it does sound similar to the sort of music Laika plays while cooking.</em>&quot;</span>

He wondered how long this song was. A few minutes longer, he hoped. Surely after this, Blues would have to relinquish him for the sake of appeasing other navis.

With the bump, Laika turned his head. Annoyance quickly faded as he processed who it was. He said nothing, signed nothing, until he realized the other was asking for a name. Did he really want to give it?

Hesitantly, Laika spelled it out with his fingers. He doubted that the other would understand.</span>

Marcatto finally managed to cut in on Enzan&#39;s dance. Other guests huffed at how he was just a tad too forceful compared to the careful considerations expected of dances. Enzan clenched his teeth in anticipation of a bumpy ride.

With a shrug, Laika went back to watching Enzan. Though he wished he didn&#39;t. That Marcatto guy had wormed his way in again. Even worse, he was dancing far too intimately!

Laika&#39;s expression turned sour as he continued to watch. He couldn&#39;t really do anything, not with Shuuseki here.

Search looked delighted to hear that. He replied to the spin with another in a different direction. 

&quot;<em>Then this is a style that I could excell in.</em>&quot; He stated. &quot;<em>I will have to practice more. Maybe at the apartment, if possible.</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;Marcatto, please.&quot; The other interrupted, &quot;only my mother calls me Marc.&quot; 

&quot;Mm. Wouldn&#39;t you rather grab a seat near my father? It looks like he&#39;s going to be eating soon. And the bidding will start in just two songs.&quot; 

&quot;I would love to, but I needed to give you a break from all those girls! I figured a friendly face would be the least I could give in exchange for how nice you are to me.&quot; Marcatto dipped Enzan rather abruptly, but smiled winningly. 

&quot;I appreciate the thought, but you know I can handle myself.&quot; As polite words slipped out, his expression dropped and tone lost inflection. 

&quot;Well, I also figured seeing you would save my evening. I just have such a terrible time without seeing you at these parties.&quot; Marcatto drew Enzan close enough to say it low. Enzan&#39;s stomach sank. He glanced around for some girl to swap off to. 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad to have helped, but I should keep moving through my queue.&quot; And with that, Enzan grabbed the arm of a delightful young lady, and continued sweeping across the floor. 

Blues&#39; face flushed completely then. &quot;I would be delighted to help. Dancing is a pleasant pastime. I love to have partners that can match my speed.&quot; He pulled a little closer, dancing on his toes to be closer to Searchman&#39;s face. &quot;Thank you for breaking my queue. I was getting tired. I will dance with Rockman for the last song... maybe the three of us can practice together at home.&quot;</span>

Marcatto was surprisingly quick to get under his skin. All these girls who begged to dance with Enzan? Laika could care less. They saw him just as a public figure, flesh and blood to fond over but always out of reach, even if he was in their arms. Laika didn&#39;t care about their fandom! But Marcatto... he had a different aura. He was a <em>threat</em>. His actions crossed the line.

Laika stood near where Marcatto was ditched, ignoring him completely. His eyes stayed on Enzan, keeping watch as he danced with another nameless girl for the remainder of the song.

Search worked up a delighted smile. This dance-- and Rock&#39;s dance-- had been really wonderful. Both would be something he would look back on in fondness.

He looked behind him as the song signaled a close, and moved their dancing to where Rockman was.

&quot;<em>It seems appropriate that I hand you off to him.</em>&quot; Searchman reasoned.</span>

The song finished, and there was a moments pause before the next one. Enzan had spotted Laika during his spinning, and made his way to him as soon as there was time to breath. 

&quot;This is our song.&quot; He promised, flashing as disarming a smile he could muster. His hand looped under Laika&#39;s arm. &quot;May I have this dance?&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Blues squeezed Searchman&#39;s hand. &quot;Don&#39;t dance with anyone you don&#39;t want to. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get asked by strangers now.&quot; He smiled a little, before placing his hand on Rockman&#39;s shoulder and making the switch.</span>

He placed a kiss to Rockman&#39;s head, hidden by his helmet. It was quick, and covered by Blues pulling Rock just a little closer. 

&quot;Just ignore her...&quot; he whispered like it was some sweet nothing, an intimate secret. &quot;I trust you. If you need me to help next time, I will.&quot; 

Tif circled around Searchman for a few bars of the song. She finally got up the courage to ask. It would, perhaps, be an awkward combination, but she was determined. 

&quot;Sir? I noticed how well you danced with the host of our party. Could I bother you for a dance?&quot;</span>

The nerves that he had all night about dancing in front of a crowd were gone in the moment. He wanted to assert himself to someone in particular, which meant showing confidence for the whole gala to see. But it also meant giving Enzan the time he probably needed. 

With a nod, Laika allowed himself to be guided onto the dance floor. This would be their time above all else. 

Searchman watched Rock and Blues take off, momentarily enchanted. He was interrupted by a pest, something buzzing around him just below sight.  He looked down when they addressed him. It was that navi he was warned about. 

&quot;<em>I request a break in dancing for the moment.</em>&quot; Searchman said as he looked back to watch Rock and Blues. &quot;<em>Apologies.</em>&quot;</span>

Much more effort was being used now than before, but it felt <em>good</em>. Their practice was paying off. His hand felt perfectly cradled in Laika&#39;s. 

Finally once they were in the rhythm of the song and more people had filled the dance floor, Enzan leaned into Laika. He smiled. The others back was straight as a military salute, but Laika&#39;s body was soft, only for him to experiance now. 

&quot;You&#39;re <em>mine</em> now.&quot; He started to murmur, probably too boldly. &quot;I&#39;m... annoyed we had to share. I think I&#39;ll keep you to myself now.&quot; The statement was being made... there was no going back. 

From the head of the room, there was the sound of glass shattering. Shuuseki had crushed one of the wine glasses in his palm. A few employees in standard butlar uniform rushed forward to clean it away. His eyes bore into Enzan&#39;s back, but he just <em>smiled</em> and held Laika closer.</span>

&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Tif shrugged, despite the annoyance and worry that raced through her. &quot;Do you mind conversation?&quot; Both these navis had been granted full access to Blues, but she still got shoved aside like part of the rabble. Couldn&#39;t she meet and talk with them, even aside from her Netops orders? Her hands clasped behind her back, trying for an innocent look.

&quot;Thank you for dancing with her despite discomfort.&quot; Both his hands lowered to Rockman&#39;s back, and they just swayed then, the middle of the song. 

&quot;This is a big party. One of the biggest in... years, really. A lot went into it. I think Ijuuin-sama feels it will make a statement amid some of the... turmoil. Enzan-sama agreed.&quot; Blues eyes half lidded when Rockman touched him. He was so warm, so.. real. 

&quot;I think I&#39;m ready to now. Yes.&quot; He leaned in, and made one graceful twirl. His dancing before had been restrained, only peeking out some of his greatness to show Searchman. Now though, he was ready to <em>fly</em> with all the grace of a ballerina.</span>

He said it loud enough some people could probably hear. He wanted them too.
Would this make a statement? Would it show they were just as strong- if not stronger- than before? Rockman wasn&#39;t sure he felt the same. Something was off..It must just be Tif.</span>

Nothing about their ferocity right now was surprising. Blues lifted Rockman up to spin him, and a space opened up for them to let loose amid the others. The crowd closed the circle, everyone clamoring to watch. 

Rockman landed, and Blues gently dipped him down. He finished the flourish of the song with a kiss. A few of the crowd squealed, others gasped, but all were showing appreciation. They whisked back into the action, like the affection was just a necessary choreograph.

Blues really was a performer at heart.</span>

That declaration that he was taken, seized even, was oddly stimulating in this moment. When Enzan was like this, showing his power, Laika liked it. He just wished he could say something to pull it out more.

The words didn&#39;t come, but a response was given regardless. Laika slid his hand further around the small of Enzan&#39;s back. He squeezed the other that was holding Enzan. 

There was no reason to let go, not even for a flourish. He had been trying so hard to respect Enzan&#39;s professional side, and stay away from even the slightest romantic gestures. Now though, he could feel that Enzan didn&#39;t care, not as much as before. Laika had to take advantage of this chance, because who knew how many hours of this stuffy gala there would be until the next chance.

Searchman kept his eyes trained on the dance, especially now that the two had started to go beyond what anyone else had shown so far. It was like a different sort of battle, hammering into place the true nature of their relationship.

&quot;<em>Talking is... fine.</em>&quot; He responded to Tif, but only after a moment of silent contemplation.</span>

It wasn&#39;t like anyone else could hear them. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be allowed to leave my side now.&quot; The words came out a warm purr. Laika was the one that pulled Enzan close enough so it rumbled in their chests, pressed together. &quot;I won&#39;t let go.&quot; 

Heat suddenly flushed over his face, but he didn&#39;t back down. He breathed deeply to stay calm and take in the moment. All that mattered was Laika. 

His partner was perfect, perfect! All he wanted was to keep bringing out that smile, and defend! Defend his heart, defend his decisions, and defend Laika. 

&quot;Ahh~ that&#39;s good. It&#39;s hard to find navis at these parties that have anything in common with me. That&#39;s why I like to talk with Blues. He&#39;s polite and doesn&#39;t brush me off.&quot; Her smile turned sheepish and she sighed, &quot;I&#39;m just so jealous that you and Rockman can so easily. Is it ok to admit that? It is the truth.&quot; She scoped out where Searchman&#39;s hand was.

&quot;My netop told me to dance with you all. I&#39;d rather talk of my own volition. You all seem nice... but I don&#39;t think Rockman likes me.&quot;</span>

He wanted another kiss- knowing it wasn&#39;t for the dance and performance was one thing, but <em>feeling</em> that way another. Thoughts of Tif and the nervousness of this party melted away as he grabbed Blues, breaking him from his dance to kiss him, much more passionately than before. 
He broke to whisper, &quot;if they want a show, and you want to be a show-off, then show <em>off,</em> boy.&quot;

Blues recovered well enough to grin and launch Rockman into a wicked spin. A single laugh broke the tension, enough for him to feel comfortable being more fluid and pushing his limits. They would dip deeper, push harder, add syncopation and get lost in each other.</span>

He dipped Enzan back as the music swelled, to accent that smirk and thought. And as the music died back, power was returned to Enzan.

At the end of it, Laika had a silent laugh. Maybe that was too bold for this setting.

&quot;<em>Is that so?</em>&quot; Searchman looked to Tif, but only after Blues recovered from Rockman&#39;s advances. &quot;<em>I did not see it. However, I admit that my perception of emotions is lacking.</em>&quot;

He looked back, interested again in the dance that was near evolving into a fight.

&quot;<em>As for how close we are... Circumstances made that so. We are comrades.</em>&quot;</span>

He slid his arm around Laika again and sighed. A glance somewhere between teasing and bashful graced his face. &quot;I should just let you lead the whole dance. Blues taught you well.&quot; Feeling Laika&#39;s laugh was a wonderful reward for picking up the responsibility again.</span>

Blues paused to hold Rockman in the dip. His processors were whirring. Both of them looked at him, almost presenting the fruits of their training to show Searchman. 

&quot;Ah... circumstances. I see. I suppose time isn&#39;t a factor then? I&#39;ve known Blues for years now... but you both still have an edge.

He didn&#39;t completely ignore her, but he still wasn&#39;t looking. Searchman heard what she said.

&quot;<em>I understand.</em>&quot; his voice was flat, like usual. &quot;<em>Perhaps in time, they will come. Friends are not instant, I have learned.</em>&quot;

Laika shrugged off the compliment, but seemed to accept it anyway. Blues <em>had</em> been a wonderful teacher, at least to untie the knots of nerves that came with the thought of Laika dancing. The ability had been there, it showed through fencing, and Blues was the key to unlocking it.

Laika made sure they stayed close, to keep a clingy Enzan nice and happy. They were comfortable like this, and he had to keep himself from showing off too much. This was the public, still.</span>

He spun away from Blues, and stood a few feet away from him- one end of the crowd murmuring some confusions. He rolled up his sleeve and pulled his glove off with his teeth, forming his buster and giving Blues and grin. Boy, this was <em>fun.</em>
He tipped his buster up, and fired a shot to the ceiling, never breaking his eye contact with Blues.</span>

The blast was still rising, and then so was Blues. He spun up into the air. A stream of energy trailed behind him as he activated a sword. It was finally whipped above his head to collide with the blast, and sent little sparks whirling overhead. Spirals of energy guided Blues&#39; gentle landing, right back into Rockman&#39;s arms.</span>

Still, as the song came to a close, he resumed clapping. He was greatly confused, but enjoyed the two nonetheless.

Laika looked up in thought. Dancing on their own would mean making space for it at home. Or finding somewhere secluded elsewhere. It would take effort, but it was doable. He nodded at the idea, agreeing with it. Dancing like this was rather nice.

He could feel the song wrapping up, and he wished he had the guts to finish it with something appropriate. But here, with all these eyes, when they were still so careful... it made Laika shy. The dip from before was all he could do. Maybe a spin now to satisfy the urge.</span>

&quot;<em>Ah... uh... goodbye.</em>&quot; He didn&#39;t even get to think about how she knew his nationality. Search then focused on Rockman.

&quot;<em>I did like it. But I question the use of weapons.</em>&quot; Search smiled a little, &quot;<em>Probably something I can not do. But the other dancing will be fun to learn eventually.</em>&quot;

The mention of the auction starting made him wonder how Laika was doing. He hadn&#39;t gotten any distress calls.

Laika was doing absolutely fine. Enzan dipping him over brought a pleasant warmth to his chest. That and the constant touch were a pleasant compromise.

He let Enzan lead him off, and only brought up his hands after they stepped into the sidelines.

&quot;{That was perfect. Thank you.}&quot; He praised.</span>

He smiled and turned back to Search, gesturing him to follow in place for the auction. &quot;We&#39;ve never done something like that. I thought about it while we were dancing, so we did it.&quot; He giggled.
&quot;It&#39;s exhilarating to dance like that in front of crowds. Personally, especially ones where Shuuseki is watching. He&#39;s not my #1 fan, so I like to rub his nose in how cool I am sometimes. How cool Blues and I are.&quot;
He stopped and stood near the edge of the crowd on the left side. He looked around for Blues, but was much too short to see over anyone. &quot;I told Blues to find us when he could during the auction. I&#39;m not sure he and Enzan are bidding on anything tonight...hm...&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Tif gave them a half-hearted wave and allowed the throngs of people to guide her away from them. At least Rockman had been a bit more polite. Maybe she could sit with them during the bid. Marcatto only wanted her to bid on one item. She scoped around for Blues, but gave up when she saw him heading towards Rockman and Searchman. She could picture how they&#39;d react to her butting in on their time. Blues would be cold, Rockman would be hostile again, and the work she&#39;d put forward to making Searchman not hate her would be erased because they would tell him how he should think, without letting him come to his own conclusion.  

Later, maybe. She was tired. Tif jacked out to prepare for the bid. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad. Let&#39;s get some water.&quot; Enzan led them to one of the refreshment tables again, just as a gentleman was getting up on the podium to speak. The man started announcing that the bid would start, and everyone involved in the early pieces got to their seats.</span>

Searchman spotted Blues, and waved to give his position. They were all going to stand together. Would that be okay? Laika had no intentions on bidding. Though he assumed Rockman didn&#39;t either. It would make more sense if the bidders stood in a separate area though. Less strain on spotters. 

&quot;<em>The elder Ijuuin presence does not exhilarate me at all.</em>&quot; Searchman admitted. &quot;<em>His obvious hatred for Laika produces too much anxiety. I am often forced to worry.</em>&quot;

Laika sipped on water slowly, keeping close to Enzan as the crowd grew nearby. There was no way he would be bidding on anything. The starting price points were already more than what he could manage to obtain from military pension. Maybe even triple that. None of it really interested him that much anyway.

Once he finished his cup, he lightly tapped Enzan&#39;s shoulder. &quot;{Anything in the auction worth note? Or is it all just haughty, rich stuff?}&quot;</span>

Everything alright?&quot; Catching the tail ends of conversations was never fun. He still wanted to discuss how <em>great</em> dancing with them both was. 

&quot;Hmm... it&#39;s mostly boring stuff. There is a computer part I have my eye on. But, there are also a few mystery items they didn&#39;t release ahead of time. They were worried they would be stolen. So, even I don&#39;t know what they are. Probably nothing practical, but we might see something impressive.&quot; Enzan shrugged. He&#39;d been through enough of these to know it was probably nothing that new. Paintings and antiques and some technology. &quot;I actually donated an old PET of mine. It&#39;s completely refitted with a blank memory bank, so no real value other than to resell to fans.&quot; He rolled his eyes. &quot;It&#39;s for charity.&quot;</span>

Laika held back a grimace. This guy kept showing up and making himself known. It was really weird, the vibe he kept giving off. It was reminiscent of a case or two he had worked on in the past.

&quot;{There&#39;s barely a contest...}&quot; Laika&#39;s hands mirrored his disbelief. He was half hoping for a classic, teenage girl passive aggression.</span>

Laika&#39;s eyes narrowed, and he crossed his arms. This was an act of showmanship, for sure. Marcatto was stressing his wealth towards someone. Enzan, maybe? Though that should already be known.

Since they were all discussing the same thing, Enzan held up his PET a little. 

&quot;Yeah but... it&#39;s weird. It&#39;s almost embarrassing?&quot; He whispered the end juuuust in case the man was closer than he thought. Enzan tried to laugh it off. &quot;It would have been worse if he&#39;d bought it ahah...&quot; 

The announcer brought out the computer part he wanted and a few other items. Blues bidded generally for a bit before passing it off to Enzan so he could make the important decisions on how much was worth spending. He ended up winning it a few thousand dollars before reaching his limit.</span>

That feeling was back. He pressed a hand to his chest and pressed down, trying to still his broken heart. He watched them slowly roll up a cart, containing...Something. The announcer&#39;s voice was somewhat far away, Rockman straining to hear- but the words &quot;C-15&quot; and &quot;to members of scilabs only&quot; had him thinking. It was...familiar. But why? 
The realization struck him hard, and his ears rang with the memory. He betrayed nothing.
L&#233;izer led the bidding. 
&quot;Blues.&quot; He whispered, and grabbed onto Blues&#39; hand with a roughness that could only be attributed to fear. &quot;You need to win that.&quot;</span>

He spun around, frantically searching through the sea of people for them. &quot;I... don&#39;t want this.&quot; His worry turned to disgust as he looked at his PET. The name of the program flashed on his screen. He closed the hologram and moved to stomp off, but crashed into Laika. 

&quot;Nn--&quot; He looked up, eyes wide. &quot;S-sorry. I&#39;m here. I uh. I got it.&quot;</span>

There was no thought about where he was, Laika just needed to get Enzan out of there. He spotted the panic immediately.

Once they were somewhere sparse, he turned to face Enzan. His hand lingered on Enzan&#39;s arm. There was confusion still in Laika&#39;s expression.

His free hand came up, only to motion for Enzan to settle and breathe. Explanations could come later.</span>

With the fuss, the auction fumbled for the next thing. Rockman wasn&#39;t paying it much mind. 
&quot;Listen.&quot; He leaned up and whispered so that Enzan couldn&#39;t hear. &quot;That&#39;s the hallucinogenic that- that <em>he</em> made. When we were first taken. He was making audio diaries about it. It was his project at Scilabs. We need to destroy it.&quot;

&quot;I need-&quot; he wheezed, &quot;I need to leave.&quot; Prickles on his neck. An empty room. Blood. Delusions. People couldn&#39;t see him like this. Not all those fans, and <em>not</em> his father. 

Enough people were seated and bidding, that they were starting to stand out. 

Blues tensed up, &quot;I do not know him. He danced with Enzan and was very odd.&quot; he looked up and winced. Was there a copyroid around? He needed to be out there now.</span>

There was furniture, where he gestured Enzan to sit.

He looked at the bidding board. L&#233;izer&#39;s name was high, fighting for first with- Marccato?
Rockman shook his head- he didn&#39;t care about the bidding- until he looked at the Navis guarding the product. Digital...Bug bounty...
Rockman felt like he was going to hurl, he thrust his hand up and called a bid eons higher than Marc or L&#233;izer.</span>

If the winning bidder didn&#39;t present the proper credentials, he wasn&#39;t sure <em>what</em> he would do. Anger flared in his chest, and there was no one to hold him back. The only thing that kept his sword hidden was the Ijuuin name. 

The bidding ended. But who was the victor?

The two guard navis closed around the bug bounty. The S4V10R source code. Or half of it at least. Allegedly this was only the source code for how it infected navis, picked apart so a company could use it to build up counters in firewalls. That&#39;s what the item description said at least. 

Blues&#39; eyes flared <em>red</em>.</span>

Laika spotted another threat coming close. He stepped closer to Enzan and Marcatto, and signed low.

&quot;I can deal with my father.&quot; Enzan muttered urgently, &quot;I need you to see if that man is still here. He can&#39;t <em>leave</em>.&quot; L&#233;izer had played innocent, but Enzan was unconvinced. No one else had been close enough to cause this. 

&quot;Marc, come on. You&#39;re safe. We&#39;re all safe here.&quot; The young man&#39;s gaze flicked between his father and the distressed. Damn. He looked for help in the crowd. Marcatto was clinging to him in an unseemely manner, still shuddering in fear. &quot;Is there a doctor here? Someone needs to call him an ambulance!&quot; Everything was building around him, shaking and information just keot flooding in--

And suddenly all was still. He stood at attention, guided by Shuuseki’s hand on his shoulder. His expression was blank, as of a switch had turned him off. Marcatto was still sobbing, but they had been seperated. 

&quot;I will get him medical attention.&quot; The man rumbled, &quot;I apologize to everyone for the disruption.&quot;</span>

The crowd thinned out, which made it easier to look for his target. His hand tapped the PET in his pocket. A summon for Searchman.

Searchman looked up, then back to Blues. &quot;<em>Laika needs me.</em>&quot;

He hesitated putting Rockman down, given how Blues entered the space. Rock has just calmed down, and he worried Blues would get him worked up again.</span>

&quot;{Dessert will be delicious though. Better than anything I can get elsewhere.}&quot; Laika reasoned. A smile came. &quot;{I want to stay until then, or else I&#39;ll regret it.}&quot;

The comment and implications of it bothered him greatly, along with everything else that happened tonight. But at the same time, some cravings just couldn&#39;t die.

Searchman took this time to return to the PET. With Enzan there, things were alright. Plus he had to explain to Blues the situation. He couldn&#39;t help but overhear Rockman&#39;s statement.

&quot;<em>In fairness, we were not the main focus. Most, if not all, of the other navis were focused on the bidding.</em>&quot;</span>

Since the bid had finished and everyone had calmed down, they had gotten on with eating. The only table with plates was the long one at the head of the room. After what they had just been through...that was okay for Enzan. 

He looked up to Laika for confirmation. 

&quot;Search is right.&quot; Blues muttered, &quot;no one of consequence noticed. And reporters aren&#39;t allowed at these. People do embarrasing things at these partys all the time.&quot; 

He frowned when Rock spoke and pulled him a bit closer. &quot;There is no reason to think he is behind any of this. It&#39;s okay. He did get deported.&quot;</span>

Searchman still folded his arms, and looked out past his comrades. Tif was his chief concern. She had made a point to keep him company, and he had acted rudely. It bothered him that because she tried, she was running the risk of being punished for it.
He had hoped for a second chance to speak with her during the gala.

Laika followed Enzan&#39;s gaze, to the long table. That was somewhere he was trying to avoid, especially with Shuuseki here. At the same time, he longed for it. The chance for them to sit together in a place like this. <em>Finally.</em>

His nodded. The anxiety was trumped by a basic need to always make progress.</span>

&quot;And we can still talk to Tif. I do not think it is a lost cause.&quot; Blues spoke slowly, but with a firmness that inspired confidence. &quot;The description said it was only parts anyways. To be used to build firewalls. It will be alright.&quot; 

Enzan smiled a little and kept on in that direction. They were once again the picture of formality and grace. He was a bit warm at the idea of his father being at the head, but after all the chaos, that was nothing. It was normal, even. Dealing with significant others and parents was...normal. 

He pulled out Laika&#39;s chair for him and sat beside him. The older people around them nodded to acknowledge their arrival. A beautiful meal was already plated and ready for them. Upon smelling it, Enzan realized how hungry he had been.</span>

The food looked really... rich. Laika hoped that he could finish the plate, but wouldn&#39;t kick himself as he usually would if he couldn&#39;t. He was too hungry and stressed to worry about pet-peeves.</span>

&quot;Wait... I have a possibility. I would like to discuss with Enzan-sama before confirmation.&quot; Rockman knew this virus better than anyone, and Searchman could help neutralize any strong emotions, if tonight was any indication. Perhaps Blues <em>wasn&#39;t</em> the most fit for duty right now, of the three of them. Backtracking on his own plan was not ideal, but... Blues chastised himself. He was not the planner. Enzan was. 

<em>He</em> was cutting into a bloody steak. Thin slices were paired with greens. He looked around a little, but tried to stay focused on his meal.</span>

The food itself was better than anything he usually has. It was a garruntee that&#39;d he&#39;d finish the portion, the struggle was to remember his high end manners while doing so. Thoughts of the man further down the table were minimal for once. 

As dessert was introduced, Laika felt his PET vibrate. He snuck it out on the side closest to Enzan, and read the screen. With it, he nudged Enzan slightly, to bring his attention.

&quot;{That&#39;s fine with me.}&quot; He gestured.

Searchman felt better about the change of plans, though he would&#39;ve accepted either decision. It would ease the tension on the three of them.

Judging by Laika&#39;s taps, he added. &quot;<em>I believe all three of us can go. Just having one or two might not sway Tif.</em>&quot;</span>

Blues waited for the answer, which came in taps to him as well. &quot;Alright... we can enter the network and make our way to the hospital, if we are in agreement.&quot; He looked to Rock the most. Would he be okay to talk with Tif. 

&quot;I just hope we do not come off as aggressive. Weapons should be away at first if all three of us go.&quot; With how odd things were, should one of them stay with the netops? He kept swaying with uncertainty. He just wanted to be told what to do, not keep making the decisions. Searchman had said it though. Three it was. Blues tried to relax.

I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re just doing whatever they want.&quot; She smiled then, &quot;you&#39;re good like that, aren&#39;t you? A good friend to them, doing whatever they want.&quot; Her tone turned condescending, and she looked at Rock. 

Blues stepped up, &quot;Tif, I would rather keep this from growing complicated. We are glad it did not fall into the wrong hands, and will be patient until Mr. Marc is himself.&quot; He looked at her with sincerity, &quot;all we ask is you do not touch the files. They are as dangerous as Searchman said. No exaggeration.&quot; 

&quot;Hm. Acting a lot different now that I have something you <em>want</em>. Maybe I&#39;ll keep it just for that.&quot; 

Blues maintained a straight face but internally grimaced.</span>

And he liked that she was interested. To have a point of contact outside of Rock and Blues. Someone new? He found himself wanting it quite a bit. 

He wanted to ask for clarity, but at the same time he remembered that Rock and Blues were volatile right now. Any wrong word could light one of their fuses.

He would refrain from comment on how Blues and Enzan operated for now, even though he knew that it was a similar relationship. Much deeper than his and Laika&#39;s. However, that was their business to explain, not his. 

Searchman smiled back, and waited for Marcatto.</span>

Then, he was gone. He was always so very thankful for his lifetime key to the entire hospital network, what with how his friend moved about so often. But he always found him.
&quot;Hey, Mamoru.&quot; His voice was gentle and much, much calmer. The walk had brought him down some. They talked gently while Mamoru started to doze, catching up on the basics. Deeper talk could be had later. He asked it bluntly, &quot;where&#39;s your navi?&quot; 
&quot;Oh, around&quot; came the response, meaning ey&#39;d be here eventually. Rockman could wait.

Rockman&#39;s appearance had been noted by Serenade ever since he entered the hospital servers. Ey knew all three of them where here. Rock, Blues, Searchman... all noted, but not kept track of. When ey were here, ey were simply a sickly boy&#39;s navi. Lord over nothing but emself. 

But when Rockman mentioned em by name, that godly surge came forth. There were tremors behind his calm words. A leaf shaking in the wind. 

&quot;We are here.&quot; Serenade spoke. Ey appeared near Rockman, standing on the same ground as him. &quot;You did not come to chat with Mamoru. What is your true intent of this visit?&quot;</span>

Which gave Serenade great concern. There was the time before when such a powerful oppression came from ICU that ey almost took action. That feeling was not here, not now. The only weight ey sensed was whatever Rockman piled on his own shoulders. What a heavy sense that was. 

&quot;How do we know that it is truly here, and not just the remnants still toying with you inside? Making you believe? How can such a thing be put up for sale?&quot;</span>

Serenade weighed eir options. Rockman was never the lying sort, and ey knew he wouldn&#39;t string together a tall tale just for attention. Even if ey could not validate Rockman&#39;s claims immediately, ey felt the need to listen, to believe.

Searchman looked at Tif, then to Blues, then back to Tif. Things had grown very tense since Marcatto&#39;s entrance. Half of his worry was still with Rockman. Alone, as he was? Or hopefully Blues took him to someone trusting. He couldn&#39;t ask now. It would ruin their dwindling chances.

The more the virus spoke, the easier it became for Serenade to find it. It was there, within reach.

Serenade closed eir eyes, and pressed a palm to Tif&#39;s chest. With the tiniest push, it passed through. The virus files were plucked from inside, and removed.

&quot;This....&quot; Serenade held up the malignant file, closed off by a protective light. Ey looked up, eyes glowing white. &quot;Is not a thing that can stay in the modern world. It was never meant to be recreated. With it we will find it&#39;s brothers, if any.&quot;

Ey smiled, serene. &quot;You kept it away from your operator, and for that we thank you.&quot;</span>

She watched the program be sealed away. Her chest tightened. 

Tif hadn&#39;t done it for selfless reasons. She just stared up at that smile. This frightening being... was being nice. Calming. It almost made her more afraid. 

She just nodded in response, shocked into stillness and quiet.</span>

Searchman&#39;s head had turned, and was now observing Tif. Something didn&#39;t settle right with him, seeing her have little to no reaction to what just happened. He had seen it <em>so many times</em> before, the total shutdown in face  of an adverse climate. He wished he could do something.

But the utterance of his name pulled him back to Rockman and Blues. After all this their bond was far stronger-- far more appealing-- than whatever was budding between himself and Tif.

His eyes narrowed, showing Tif obvious pain over leaving so abruptly. But this had to be done. He turned away, and followed his comrades out of the place.</span>

Her one chance at making a difference in her existance was dashed away by an almighty force. If the God down here wasn&#39;t even on her side, what could she possibly count on?

&quot;Marcatto is there. His influence is too great.&quot; He sounded a little defeated. &quot;My staying there would probably result in a boot.&quot;

He really wished that wasn&#39;t the case, but he had to be realistic. Just like in his own experiences, the operator had more control than one would expect.

Laika put his hands together, seemingly blessing the empty plate in front of him. That torte was the single most delicious thing he had this year. So far. He was so thankful.

&quot;{Let me know where they got this.}&quot; He gestured at the empty plate. He smiled for a second before continuing. &quot;{I&#39;m ready to go, this has been enough.}&quot;</span>

&quot;I will ask the chief to recreate it for you.&quot; Enzan promised. He made a mental note of whatever Laika showed preference for. 

He quietly stood up and pushed in his chair, smiling as he did. He nodded a few times and smiled and waved to other guests. His parting words were important to many of the people here.</span>

Ey traveled back to Mamoru&#39;s room with the virus. The admin had a right to see this. Plus, ey still felt the need to teach him just what to be cautious of. The virus was like poison ivy, and Serenade the guide to a novice hiker.

Searchman nodded in thanks. He wasn&#39;t sure if Tif did truly appreciate him. So much of this was both new and old. He couldn&#39;t exactly fit his past experiences into solutions for here and now.

&quot;I will alert Laika that we are on our way back.&quot; Search needed to occupy himself. &quot;They should be finished with the dinner by now.&quot;

Laika smiled more. Enzan really was the best... The promise of tasting that again helped him be patient with the farewells. As long as he was able to stick by Enzan, he was fine.

He kept his hands behind his back as he followed, content and not finding much of a need to sign. He didn&#39;t know any of these people anyways.</span>

No, the inaction from earlier still bothered him. 

He took the moment to seek out the address he wanted. Finding things that were hidden or unknown was his talent. Then came the message.

He pressed the send button without thinking, and off the data soared to Tif.

Once Laika and Enzan exited the gala proper, an arm looped around his date&#39;s. He signed from there.

He felt the need to see out Enzan&#39;s hand, so he did. 

That wasn&#39;t their biggest problem, the navis had went off to take care of that. He still didn&#39;t know the results, but judging by the calm(?) return, there wasn&#39;t horrible news. There would be a lot to this night still, and it was already getting late.
