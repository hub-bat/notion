He could feel Rockman&#39;s intensity, but also the uncertainty of the future. It rattled him. He choked on his voice and tried to pull back, let Rock take the lead. No one was coming. His father couldn&#39;t hear him, even if he was here. Maybe he didn&#39;t care. 

Enzan used his rags of clothing to force the tears and snot away. It did little to help; it was drenched in sweat. Was he hallucinating all of this? Would Rockman&#39;s voice soon be a fragment of Regal&#39;s drugs as well? Give the hope and strip it away... 

He didn&#39;t want to believe that yet. So he sobbed in Rockman&#39;s arms.</span>

Blues was the first to find the building. The searching was taking too long, and he was overworking himself to give aid. Finally, finally, he found it. Blues shoved the door open, no waiting for other responders. His cybersword split open the hidden door to the basement of an old warehouse.</span>

&quot;Hm?&quot; A casual turn, a glance at the new visitor. Then a smile. &quot;You&#39;re late. I expected you weeks ago.&quot; 
Again that sickly sweet smile, as he stood near Enzan- clearly ready to snatch him up.

Enzan blinked, and focused on the doorway as ordered. His feet weakly shuffled to push him into the corner of the room. &quot;Stay away... don&#39;t want- stay a-way--&quot; He felt like he was in a dream, where no matter how hard he ran, he moved nowhere. All of the figures in the room were a threat, Blues only compounded that. 

Blues&#39; vision blurred. &quot;Step away from him.&quot; Murder boiled every 1 and 0 in his coding. His sword hissed down his arm. Enzan flinched and Blues could see his breathing shudder.</span>

But, the knowledge that Blues could not kill, both for Enzan&#39;s sake and for his own primary directive did not take away his urge. The emotions were too strong-- Blues was drowning. He was not sure he could complete his duty like this. 

He reached into his own programming. Enzan was so scared. Of <em>him</em>. 

Perhaps it wasn&#39;t because of the logic errors cropping up in his visor. Maybe it was just selfish. 

Blues turned off his emotion data. His sword went away, and his expression dropped as well. Protect Enzan. That was the only directive. Nothing else mattered now.</span>

Enzan squirmed and cried-- he didn&#39;t want to relive this again. He&#39;d already seen it all, he knew the outcome. 

&quot;We are going home now.&quot; Blues tried to mimic his usual inflection, but it was flat. &quot;You are safe. Please be calm.&quot; His hand&#39;s placement meant that the unmarked PET was in Enzan&#39;s field of vision. 

&quot;Stop-- stop! Don&#39;t touch me!&quot; Enzan punched Blues&#39; chest. The navi had to tighten his hold to keep Enzan steady. 
-
&quot;Rockman, you&#39;re nearly free.&quot; Role promised, still in the same soothing tone. &quot;It&#39;s okay to be scared. But you won&#39;t have to be, anymore. I&#39;m here over call. Blues is carrying the PET you are in. He&#39;s rescued Enzan.&quot;</span>

Blues pushed the door open to the outside. It was lightly snowing over the barren shipyard. Enzan shivered violently. He had barely any clothes left on, and it had always been a constant temperature in the building&#39;s holding cell. 

&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; <em>Bad dream. No no no.</em>

Jolt. Tick tock, how much time had passed? Rockman forced himself to his feet and pinged his system and the nearest server for an RTC check. 
<em>Scilabs Address XXX.XXX.XXX: 0700</em>
What? Rockman nearly said it, but knew that speaking when he did not know who was around was a bad idea. He pinged again, same answer. A masked address whispered fake, danger. But the only masked address he knew...was his room. 
&quot;Regal?&quot; He tested, making sure it sounded as aggressive as he could manage. &quot;You sunnova- Where are you?!&quot;
He couldn&#39;t feel Enzan&#39;s presence beyond the walls. He pushed his arms out and felt...someone else. He stumbled back, and tried to summon his buster again to failure.

&quot;Rockman, it&#39;s Role. I&#39;m here. You&#39;re in your Scilabs homepage.&quot; Role stepped back from Rock, not wanting to scare him any further.

The surprise on Doctor Hikari&#39;s face did nothing to mask the wince.

That same static noise. He dropped again. 
Doctor Hikari ran a hand over his face. <em>&quot;If I ever see the person who did this to him, they will not look very pretty after our encounter.&quot;</em> His voice was measured, but hurt, very clearly so. <em>&quot;I apologize for his behavior, Role.

He didn&#39;t want to say it. <em>&quot;I fear there may not be much we can do beyond physically healing him.&quot;</em></span>

The ringing sound ran through the netspace. 

&quot;Hello.&quot; Blues&#39; voice, dull and expressionless, came through. &quot;Rockman, Role.&quot; 

&quot;Hi Blues. Rockman wanted to see you. And thank you for saving him.&quot; Role stroked Rockman&#39;s arm, more for her own comfort now. It was hard to say how they would react to each other.</span>

He sounded so...Happy. He touched the screen, then remembered it was a screen and recoiled back. &quot;Blues, Blues where are you? Can I come see you? I miss you so much, Blues-&quot;
He grew quieter. Blues&#39; reactions were sinking in, slowly- those weren&#39;t the right ones-? Why wasn&#39;t Blues asking how he was? Why wasn&#39;t Blues here- why didn&#39;t Blues come and save him personally-?
&quot;Ah- er, m&#39;sorry. Role said you weren&#39;t feeling okay either.&quot;
He messed with his hands, and then pressed his hand to the screen. It was clumsy, but he managed.

He ended up making the blanket wrap around them both. It seemed to change length as needed. 
&quot;Mm. It isn&#39;t really...n-nice.&quot;
It was clear he was holding something back there. &quot;I-I can&#39;t do that...En-Enzan can&#39;t...I-I wanna h-help him with the h-hurt...Ugh.&quot;
He let himself fall against Role. &quot;Wi-Wish I could d-do that. My sy-system is <em>loud.</em>&quot;</span>

I know.&quot; Role began stroking his head, hoping that despite the helmet, it was comforting. 

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want <em>you</em> to leave too.&quot; She whispered this, reverently, like a secret. &quot;And I know that&#39;s not fair either. But, these bad feelings, you don&#39;t have to face them alone. Lots of friends are here for you. We have your back. Gonna help you feel safe and quiet down.&quot;</span>
