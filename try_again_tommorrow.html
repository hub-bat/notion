He’d had this type of conversation with his partner before. And in this moment, the spirit reminded him so much of his partner. 

He ran a hand through the spirit’s hair, trying to help soothe him.

“When my partner thought you were one and the same, he thought the same thing. That he was evil, that he was bad for me. He might still think the same thing.”

He moved off the bed, sat down next to the spirit. He continued running his hand through the spirit’s hair.

“I never thought my partner was evil. I still don’t. Even if he did bad things, it doesn’t make him evil. He protects me, he makes me happy, he sees more in me than I can see in myself. Even if I shouldn’t, I love him.”

He paused. “I loved him when I thought you were one and the same. Now that I know the truth…that hasn’t changed.”

“You’re hurting. You’ve been lost and confused and ignored and it hurt you,” he went on. “You’re not evil, I won’t believe that. Your power has protected me. When I spoke to the other spirit in my dream…he told me you sealed yourself away to prevent a tragedy. That’s not evil.”

He even managed to smile. “I won’t believe that you’re evil. I’ll believe as hard as it takes, until you can believe it too.”</span>

He hated himself for it, but the cry that came out of him was so <em>pained</em> and <em>sad</em> it couldn&#39;t be helped. He leaned into Yugi&#39;s touch like it was a lifeline. 

And Yugi could properly touch him, too- at least a little. Wisps of hair passed through his fingers just as they would if he were real. It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it was better than what he had with Yami.

<em>&quot;W-When he touched my cheek,&quot;</em> He mumbled, in-between awful tears he wished he would stop crying. <em>&quot;I could feel- h-how loved he was. H-How they loved him. H-How- how you loved him. A-And-&quot;</em>

He shook his head. He was so mad at himself that he was getting <em>care</em> from Yugi when he&#39;d just tortured him. But there was truth to what Yugi had said. He was confused. He was lost. 

And he was hurt. Unbelievably so. Try as he might to fight it, Yugi picking Yami over him struck some terrible chord inside him. He knew it was right. He knew it made sense. But that didn&#39;t help how it made him feel unwanted. 

The thoughts caught up to him. He hid his face again, sobbing out his tears that came in golden rivers. He hadn&#39;t learned yet how to quiet them, so Yugi would be able to hear all of the torrential downpour in his mind. But the loudest of all was the words he&#39;d left unspoken: <em>I want to be loved like that, too.</em></span>

“They told us something, when I told them about my dream. They said that the spirit they knew…used to act the way that you did. That he used to be angry and hurt people, too. He learned how to be kind and gentle. And they said we could teach you, too.”

He moved closer, wrapped an arm around the spirit.

“My partner used to terrify me. Like I said, he did bad things. He hurt people. Before I knew what was happening, why he did what he did, I used to be so scared. And when you started influencing him, I was scared then, too. My partner and I didn’t start out the way we are now. It happened over time, as the two of us became better able to connect.”

He pressed his forehead gently against the spirit’s head. 

“You and I, we’ve only just begun to connect. This is only the beginning of our relationship. You deserve to love, and you deserve to be loved. And they love him.”</span>

Deserve to love. 

Atem never thought of that. Never thought that he was deserving not only to <em>be</em> loved, but to give it, too. There was something deep inside of him that was wired against the idea, like it was wrong. But hearing Yugi say it, feeling his touch- he believed it, then, even for just a fleeting second. 

He lifts his head up to look at Yugi. They both look terrible, snotty, cried their poor eyes out. Both of them had messy hair and red ringed eyes and...

It was human. He had to take some stock in that. 

<em>&quot;He&#39;s waking up,&quot;</em> Atem murmured. <em>&quot;I- I will go. For now. But if you&#39;ll...have me again. I would like that.&quot;</em>

He seems to hesitate, before leaning in. His forehead touches Yugi&#39;s, and their noses brush. He holds the pose for a moment, eyes shut. 

When he opens them again, it&#39;s Yami. And Yami slumps against him, clearly not fully awake again. But...he&#39;s retained the way Atem had more of a stronger form. 

Maybe Atem was doing that for him. 

<em>&quot;Partner,&quot;</em> he breathed. <em>&quot;Y-You&#39;re alright.&quot;</em></span>

“I’m okay,” he promised. “Partner, I was so worried for you, I… I’m glad you’re okay. I’m so sorry, I…”

He wasn’t sure how to finish the sentence. He moved his face to kiss his partner on the cheek.</span>

Half because he was so tired, but half because...he knew Yugi was correct. This had shown him that it was true- Yugi&#39;s guidance was strong, just. 

He kept coming back to kissing him, over and over. After moments like these, he just couldn&#39;t let him go far. <em>&quot;...I will learn to love him, as you learned to love me.&quot;</em> He nodded, resolute in his own decisions.

<em>&quot;...Atem.&quot;</em> He murmured the name, softly. He wasn&#39;t sure he had said it yet before. <em>&quot;He has a nice name.&quot;</em> He looked up at Yugi again, blinking slow. 

<em>&quot;... Long day. I think we should sleep.&quot;</em> It was too difficult to keep it together, to keep up his formal persona. He tested his head down on the carpet.</span>

“We’ll learn to love Atem together.” Yugi could feel his heart leaping. Atem wanted to be loved, needed that love, and Yugi wanted so badly to give him that love. Maybe he was already starting to. He was so tired, it was hard to tell.

He gave his partner another kiss. He needed so badly to make sure his partner knew he loved him. Whatever his feelings surrounding Atem were, that hadn’t changed.

“I think we should sleep, too.” Yugi ran a hand through Yami’s hair. He knew they should probably sleep on the bed, that it would be more comfortable. It was so tempting to just sleep here on the carpet, though. His partner was here with him, and that was all he needed.

“I love you, my partner.”</span>

When his form faded, it didn&#39;t feel like he was truly gone- warmth spread over Yugi like a blanket. And there was a nice, particular warmth on the puzzle around his neck. 

At least it was better now. 

At least he was...home.</span>

Tomorrow, the day rose with golden sunlight in the window. It was particularly strong. Yami found himself waking up to Yugi already up- what time was it? He wasn&#39;t sure (truth be told, he wasn&#39;t sure what day it was, either). They weren&#39;t at school, so...

He appeared next to Yugi, peeking at what he was doing. A book on ancient Egypt. Ah- made sense. He smiled, pressed a kiss behind his ear. <em>Good morning. Already doing your research?</em>

Yugi was always so thoughtful. It made Yami feel so full of pride, and it radiated off of him like the sun through their windows. <em>Find anything interesting?</em></span>

He sat at his desk while he read, but he couldn’t sit still. He was antsy, wanting to act and help Atem without needing to prepare. But he couldn’t do that without arming himself with knowledge. He wanted to help Atem as best as possible.

It was the least he could do, for his new friend.

He kicked his feet as he read. Yugi didn’t notice Yami was awake until he was kissed. Yugi shivered, a big smile on his face.

“Good morning, partner.” He turned so he could see his partner’s face. “I didn’t want to put the research off. He needs us, and I don’t want to hurt him more than I already have.”

He looked back down at his book. “The section I’m reading now is talking about architecture and art. I don’t know how much it’ll help, but it doesn’t hurt too—“

He stopped himself in his tracks.

An art piece stared up at him, two people with their noses touching, with a caption explaining its significance. Yugi’s face immediately turned <em>bright</em> red.

How did he begin to explain this one?

“It’s a good thing I didn’t skip this section,” he wheezed.</span>

But that would be a lie. And Yami knew he had to learn to accept that truth to help the spirit. He pressed another kiss to Yugi&#39;s cheek when he faced him, saying it in his own way. 

He couldn&#39;t stay troubled for long, though. When Yugi was interested in something, it was so pure and bright. It always fought the darkness away. He peeked down at the book, listening-

<em>&quot;Hm? Why the face, partner?&quot;</em>

He looked at the book, and his hand came out to trace the words. He was a bit embarrassed by his difficulty in reading, but he got there in the end. Touching noses in Egyptian art typically was a way to depict the two people were kissing. He paused for a long time, and you could <em>see</em> the gears turning over in his head. His own cheeks turned a bit pink. 

<em>&quot;...Did he,&quot;</em> Yami murmured, <em>&quot;Did he do this with you? Yesterday?&quot;</em></span>

He sat the book down on the desk and turned to face Yami.

“He said he wanted to be loved, and he…”

He was too embarrassed to say it, describe it. He leaned his forehead against Yami’s, touched his nose against Yami’s. He closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath.

“He did this… He…”

Atem… Atem had kissed him? He?? Kissed Yugi??? 

Yugi opened his eyes and pulled away from his partner.

That did <em>not</em> make it better. Yami found himself covering his face. <em>&quot;Partner...I think he-&quot;</em>

Yami nearly jumped right up in the air. There was the <em>very</em> faint image of Atem, sitting on the bed. He looked innocent enough, and when Yami looked at him, he looked away. <em>&quot;N-No! No, er-&quot;</em>

Yami looked at Yugi, making a gesture. This was new. They&#39;d never been able to see him like this before.</span>

So, the three of them could see each other… All at the same time…

His face was still red. Yugi picked up the book, keeping it open, and stood up. He walked over to Atem and showed him the page.

“Did you know this? When? Last night? Or…”

He tried to make it come out casual and gentle, but he was still flustered enough that it came out stutter-y and squeaky instead. His heart was beating so fast, he wasn’t sure <em>what</em> he was feeling right now.</span>

He flushed. <strong>&quot;I...Cannot read what that says. But this feels familiar,&quot;</strong> he points to the art. <strong>&quot;I know it is something you do for those who you care for. Which- is why I did it with you, Yugi.&quot;</strong>

Yami was internally losing it. He stared at Yugi. Were they really certain Yami and Atem were different?

<strong>&quot;D-Did I do something wrong?&quot;</strong> Atem glanced to Yami, and...oh. Yami felt terrible when he saw the fear on his face. <em>&quot;N-No, no. I assure you, nothing is wrong. It was just surprising. Do not worry.&quot;</em>

He looked at Yugi. <em>Was that right?</em></span>

He closed the book and sat down next to Atem. He flashed him a bright smile.

<em>&quot;Is- Is there something wrong?&quot;</em>

Atem stood up, and walked over to Yami. Yami opened his mouth to ask what he wanted, not moving- until Atem reached up and cupped his cheek, pressing their foreheads together just the same. 

<strong>&quot;I wanted you to also know I care for you,&quot;</strong> Atem murmured when they parted. He yawned, then. <strong>&quot;It is hard to do this. I am going to sleep.&quot;</strong>

And he was gone. And Yami was left there, stunned to silence, looking like a stop sign with how red he was. <em>&quot;P-Par-tn-er?&quot;</em> He stuttered, gesturing wildly. <em>&quot;H- H-He??? Wh- What-???&quot;</em>

He looked a lot like Yugi then, just as he had when they found the book. <em>&quot;Whhhh-whatdowedoaboutthis?&quot;</em> He rushed out.</span>

Immediately, he opened the book up to the same page, and pointed to the picture.

“He?? Kissed both of us??”

Yugi forced himself to breathe. He needed to be calm enough to get words out.

“I don’t think he realizes exactly what this means? Should we tell him?? What this means?? Does he have romantic feelings for us??”

<em>Did</em> Atem having romantic feelings for Yugi and Yami? And what about Yugi? Did he feel that way about Atem in return? His heart was beating so fast, he didn’t know,

Yugi hid his face in the book. “I don’t know how to have this conversation. I don’t know who to ask for advice about this.” He felt like he was going to explode. He might just explode instead of having this conversation, instead of figuring out <em>what</em> he felt for Atem. He just might explode.</span>

He reached over, tried to peek over the book. <em>&quot;That is the step one, right? Earning his trust, and giving it in return.&quot;</em>

He paused. Then, he smirked. <em>&quot;Oh, Yugi. You are not falling for the spirit of the puzzle, are you? After a single show of affection? If I had known it was so easy...&quot;</em>

This was more his speed, at least. He felt some measure of control back at the teasing.</span>

“No?? Yes?? I don’t know?? You’re my partner and I love you so much and that’ll never change but I don’t— I don’t know— I—“

His face was flushed a bright red. He squeaked again. <em>Was</em> he falling for the spirit of the puzzle? For Atem? Did the fact that he couldn’t definitively say no mean that the answer was yes?

Did he like Yami <em>and</em> Atem?</span>

He kissed his forehead. <em>&quot;You have always felt such warmth for me, even when we believed the spirit and I were one. It makes sense you would feel that warmth for him too, even though we now know the nature of he and I.&quot;</em>

He leaned against Yugi. Having this more solid form was something he could get used to. <em>&quot;You have always been full of such light. I would be selfish to keep it all to myself.&quot;</em> 

Though...He wasn&#39;t sure his own emotions about Atem. Where did Yugi&#39;s end, and his begin? The affection had been nice, and soothed some of his worries about poor impressions. But- he still couldn&#39;t shake it. The thoughts he had heard...the rage he knew was still inside of the spirit. <em>&quot;...I am still learning, myself. There are many questions I do not have answers to. But, be rest assured, I am not...&quot;</em> 

He gestured. <em>&quot;It was one thing if you had feelings for the older spirit. This one, well...I could handle.&quot;</em> He laughed a little, hoping he had said what his partner needed to hear. Everything was fine. It wasn&#39;t as if they were going to be typical, anyway.</span>

He couldn’t help a smile at the thought. His partner didn’t mind, if he did in fact like Atem. Knowing that made him feel a lot lighter. It was okay. Everything was okay.

He managed a giggle. “I don’t have those kinds of feelings for the older spirit. He was very nice, I’d like to think we could be friends, but he’s not <em>my</em> Atem.”

He leaned forward and kissed his partner on the cheek. “It’s okay to be a little selfish… my love is only for you, and maybe for Atem, but that’s it. No one else.”</span>

<em>&quot;Put your research to work, hm? And...we should see him. I would like to assure he is alright.&quot;</em> And he was truthful, seen clearly in his eyes, and the bit of a bashful look on his face.</span>

“You’re right, we should check on him,” he agreed. “I want to make sure he’s okay, too.” He reached out and held Yami’s hands in his own. 

He would be lying if he said he didn’t  just want to see Atem again, too. The thought made his heart leap. Being able to see two of his favorite people side by side… The idea meant a lot to him.</span>

Yami hesitated at the door, suddenly. Where he would have been fine to enter, now, it made him uneasy. Like he was trespassing. He didn&#39;t have long to worry over it, though, because Atem opened the door himself. 

&quot;I heard you both enter,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Did you want something from me?&quot;

Behind him on the floor of the room was a half-complete, pure white puzzle. Yami eyed it with curiosity, but waited for Yugi to speak. He found his hand taking his partner&#39;s and holding it tightly- his only show of nervousness.</span>

“Hi!” He waved to Atem with his other hand. “We both wanted to check on you. Make sure you’re okay.” With his free hand, he fidgeted with the puzzle around his neck. “We were thinking about you, and, wanted to make sure you’re happy. You deserve to be happy, too.”

Wanting the other person to be happy. Wasn’t that love?

Yugi shoved the sudden thought down. Now wasn’t the time to get flustered again.</span>

&quot;I am okay.&quot; Atem responded, tone flat. There was a bit of confusion leaking into his expression. It looked like he didn&#39;t know what else to say. 

&quot;Would you like- ah,&quot; Yami found himself hesitating. He wanted to do good by Yugi, wanted to protect him, wanted to guide him. &quot;Would you like to spend time with us. We have much to learn from each other.&quot;

Atem blinked. The beats of silence made Yami feel a bit worried. But then, the spirit smiled. 

&quot;I would like that. Ah- it is...not very kind in here,&quot; He glances back at his room, the endless stairs leading to nowhere. Yami shrugs his shoulders. &quot;Nonsense. You and I can make things as we please, no?&quot;

Atem blinked as Yami walked in, and...oh, was that a bit of pink on his cheeks? It didn&#39;t last long, as he followed behind him. &quot;Is this yours?&quot;

&quot;Y-Yes.&quot; Atem looked at the pure white puzzle. It was about halfway done, but had parts that seemingly had been taken away and put together a few times. &quot;I-It...appeared, after I spoke to Yugi, the first time.&quot;

Yami smiled. &quot;That does not surprise me. Yugi has always offered wonderful gifts, even if he does not know it.&quot; They both sat down across from each other on the floor of the room, Yami pulling Yugi in next to him. He shot him a glance. <em>This is good, right?</em>

&quot;I...I have been struggling with it. The pieces are...they seem to go in some places but not others. But all of it is completely white...&quot; Atem sighed, looking intensely at it. &quot;I do not understand it.&quot;</span>

Yugi’s own cheeks turned pink as he sat down next to Yami. He flashed Yami a smile and leaned against him. This was good.

“I didn’t realize I gave you a gift.” Yugi fiddled with the chain around his neck. “If I had control over it, I would’ve given you one with a picture. It’d be easier…”

He glanced down at the puzzle on the ground. It reminded him of that one puzzle from school, the one where you write a message and give it to someone else to solve. But this one was completely blank. Not even a message written out on it.

“Usually the point of a puzzle is to try to assemble the picture the puzzle depicts, but there isn’t one on this one. I wonder why it’s blank…”</span>

Yami hummed, leaned forward. &quot;It helps to complete the outside, first. Then you know what pieces belong in the middle. You&#39;ve been working on it from one side, to the other.&quot;

Atem listened to him patiently. The two of them seemed like they were connecting in some way. Yami turned and pressed a kiss to Yugi&#39;s head, not thinking much of it in the moment.

When his attention came back, he noticed Atem staring at him. &quot;...Something the matter?&quot;

Atem shook his head. He was starting to fill in the edges of the puzzle. &quot;I do not remember ever solving a puzzle like this. I have no muscle memory for it, either, so it may never have been something I have done before. Some things, I do. Rolling dice,&quot; he was babbling a bit at this point. &quot;I can recall that. And- some sort of cards. But there is no visual. Just the feeling of them.&quot;

He seemed to come back to himself. He&#39;d solved a side of the puzzle then. &quot;Ah- s-sorry. I-&quot;

&quot;You have not had companions to speak to in a very long time, that did not want something from you. We are listening.&quot; The longer the interactions with Atem went on, the more Yami was picking up how...<em>similar</em> they were. Yami laughed softly and couldn&#39;t help another bout of affection, his hand coming up to card through Yugi&#39;s hair. &quot;Perhaps they really did play Duel Monsters in ancient Egypt, hm?&quot; 

He always thought Pegasus&#39;s story about that was a bit bullshit.</span>

The best Yugi could recall was that it was very messy in there. He should clean up in there sometime. If Atem could see it like that, it was a little embarrassing. He couldn’t even give Atem something nice to look at.

Yugi hummed happily into the affection, wrapping an arm around Yami. He was content to just watch Yami and Atem bond. It made him very happy to see.

At the mention of cards and dice, though, he got excited. “If you used to play games, then we should play games together sometime! We could duel sometime! Or there’s a new game I tried out where you roll dice, you might like that. Maybe you’d like playing blackjack! Or…”

The possibilities were endless. So many games to try! Yugi would have to look around his room at the games he owned to see if there was anything he thought Atem might like. If Atem liked games, that was perfect, because it was something all three of them could do and share together.</span>

&quot;Dice,&quot; he murmured, paused. He gestured and in his hands produced two diamond shaped dice. He rolled them onto the ground. 

Yami watched, and then looked surprised. &quot;That- when we were...&quot;

The dice spun and hit each other, controlling the outcome (though, these dice had no values on them). &quot;I have never been able to do that again, after we did so during that game with the ring...&quot;

&quot;I had to aid you in that time.&quot; Atem went back to the puzzle, the dice disappearing. &quot;Yugi&#39;s soul being trapped in a figure meant if I could not win, you would be lost too. So I used your abilities- to be in his body, use it, and helped.&quot;

Yami hummed. That explained some of the holes in what they had experienced. &quot;So you grant me to power to participate in a shadow game...And I grant you the ability to be with Yugi.&quot;

Atem nodded, and he had finished another corner. Even though it appeared he had never solved a jigsaw puzzle before, he was doing very well. 

&quot;We are a good team, then.&quot; Yami smiled. &quot;To care for him.&quot; He turned and kissed his head again. Which made Atem pause, and stare. Again. 

Yami couldn&#39;t let this one go. &quot;Do you- er...Is there something the matter, when I give him a kiss?&quot;

&quot;Why do you do that?&quot; He asked simply. You could tell it was an innocent curiosity. 

&quot;Ah...Because I care for him deeply.&quot; Oh dear. He recalled what Atem had done with them both earlier, and took Yugi&#39;s hand again. 

&quot;Should I do that? I care for him deeply, as well.&quot; 

Yami fought off the urge to choke on his words. &quot;A-Ahm,&quot; he looked down at Yugi. &quot;I-I suppose that is up to him.&quot; <em>Oh dear.</em></span>

Yami couldn&#39;t help but stare at him with a similar, focused expression. His hand squeezed Yugi&#39;s a bit tighter- he wanted to keep him safe, and...

Atem pressed a kiss to Yugi&#39;s forehead, just like Yami had. It was soft. He smiled after. &quot;That is nice. I see why you do it often.&quot;

Yami let out a breathy, nervous laugh. &quot;Y-Yes. I care for him very much, so, I like to...show my affection.&quot;

Atem nodded, and returned to the puzzle. Yami loosened his hold on Yugi&#39;s hand, and took to running his thumb up and down it instead. Checking in, making sure he was alright.</span>

Oh.

That was in fact very nice and Yugi felt like he was going to explode. So if that felt nice, he probably did like Atem, more than a normal amount.

Oh.

His face remain red. He looked up at Yami with a smile. He…he definitely liked Atem. He was happy. He was okay. A little better than okay.

…Did Atem like him back, though?

Yugi started fiddling with the chain around his neck with his free hand again. “That was nice. Thank you.”</span>

Yami couldn&#39;t help but feel his own heart skip a beat when he saw that smile. It looked a lot like Yugi. If he lingered on it too long he feared both he and Yugi were going to become puddles. And puddles were not very good conversation partners. 

&quot;Do you know why you cannot go into Yugi&#39;s room?&quot; He asked, watching him continue to work on the puzzle. He may even finish it while they were here. 

&quot;Mmm.&quot; Atem made a thoughtful sound. &quot;I...I believe I am...how should I put this...&quot;

He looked a little nervous. &quot;Your room is pure, innocent. I am not. Therefore, I do not belong in there. Thus, I cannot go in there.&quot;

Yami frowned. &quot;That seems judgemental. Yugi certainly would allow you in there.&quot;

Atem made a sound again. &quot;Mm. Maybe. But it is as it is. This room is where I am meant to be.&quot;

Yami looked up at the stairs and doors leading to traps and who knows where. He remembered the nightmare he had here, scaring Yugi. Was that all his own nightmare? Had Atem been influencing his dreams- and if so, in what way? Was he the aggressor...Or did he fear the same as Yami did? He wasn&#39;t sure what to say. He didn&#39;t want to insult the place, but it was dangerous. Atem...Atem was learning to not be dangerous. Yami began to believe in the pureness in his heart.</span>

“I wouldn’t say my room is pure… It’s kind of a mess.” Immature and childish, if Atem’s description was apt. “But I think you both should be allowed in it whenever you want. If I’m allowed in your room, I don’t see why the opposite shouldn’t be true.”

He looked at the room around them. It was large and full of mystery, just as Atem was a mystery to him. 

“You deserve to have more fun stuff in your room. Stuff that you like. You deserve to be happy here.”</span>

Yami hummed. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I have ever tried to go in there. But I have seen it. I would agree with Atem. The mess is a good thing. It reflects you, in a pure and lovely way.&quot;

Atem made another sound, just indicating that he was listening. He wasn&#39;t terribly verbal, Yami noticed. Only spoke when directly spoken to. Maybe that was what it was like as a Pharaoh...Maybe he wasn&#39;t spoken to often, or had to learn to be quiet, or...

&quot;Is there something you would like? Perhaps we can do something of it.&quot; 

Atem paused. &quot;...You both like that card game. The one with the monsters on it. I want to see it, if that is possible.&quot;

Yami perked up. &quot;Oh- ah. Duel Monsters. Yes. I like it very much. I thought you may have seen it before, already...&quot;

&quot;You enjoy it very much. I only lend my power. You are the one who plays it.&quot; Atem glanced up. &quot;But it makes you both very happy. If I am to learn to coexist, I should know what makes you happy, shouldn&#39;t I?&quot;</span>

The second Duel Monsters was brought up, however, he looked up, excited. “Dueling is tons of fun! Hold on, I bet my deck’s in my room!”

He got up and ran out of Atem’s room and into his own room. He quickly spotted it: three identical copies of his deck. Yugi scooped the cards into his hands and quickly ran back to Atem’s room. He sat down once again at Yami’s side, going back to leaning against his partner. 

He held out one of the decks for Atem to take. “Here, you can see the cards we use.”</span>

&quot;Do not worry of it.&quot; He urged. &quot;If he is offering it, it is alright. You can trust in his guidance.&quot;

Atem stared, then nodded, very carefully holding the cards in his hands. He still couldn&#39;t read the text on them very well- he knew it <em>was</em> text, and it was something familiar, but the letters looked to be in the wrong places to him, a jumbled mess. He carefully looked through each one. He stopped on one.

&quot;This one is very warm,&quot; he noted, and showed it to them. Yami couldn&#39;t help a laugh. &quot;That was a gift, from Yugi to me. His first gift to me. I care for it very much.&quot; The Kuriboh card. That felt like a lifetime ago...

&quot;It is cute,&quot; Atem murmured, looking back down at it. He ran his fingers over the art. &quot;And you play a game with these. It is very serious, from what I know.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, yes.&quot; Yami sighed. &quot;Some days I wish it was simply a game, but, it is the nature of our existence, it seems. Most games are very high stakes.&quot; 

&quot;I remember...That sounds familiar.&quot; Atem paused. He showed a card to the two of them. &quot;What is this? This picture, it feels familiar.&quot; It was Dark Magician.</span>

“It used to be just a game, but it’s caused so many bad things to happen… But, the game connects me to so many people and has helped me make so many friends.” Yugi smiled. “It’s not all bad. There’s a lot of good, too. It helps connect me to my partner.”

Yugi leaned forward to get a better look at the card Atem showed them. “Oh, that’s Dark Magician! He’s another one of my favorites. He’s one of my strongest cards. There aren’t many cards stronger than him, other than Blue-Eyes White Dragon…”

He thought back to his dream. The tablet he was shown. The tablet that showed Atem… As well as…

“You said Dark Magician is familiar? He’s on that tablet, the one in the museum you wanted to see. Maybe… Maybe Dark Magician is part of your memories.”</span>

Yami struggled for a second. You could tell he wanted to say something, but was unsure. He shifted. &quot;...Perhaps it will come in time.&quot;

But coming in time, him remembering- that felt dangerous. The more Atem could remember about his life, the more dangerous things could get- the more of a chance he and Yugi would be separated, like the older Yugi. And he had seen the figure of Dark Magician inside DuelAdvance...

But Atem didn&#39;t seem to notice the struggle. He smiled, holding it to his chest. &quot;I do have a very strong feeling that he is a friend. Good to watch over you both.&quot;</span>

He looked up at Yami. Reached to wrap his hand around Yami’s, squeezing his hand gently. It would be okay. Yugi would make sure everything would be okay. Whatever it took to keep his partner by his side.

“Dark Magician’s a very good friend to me, so I’m glad he’s your friend, too. He’s helped us through lots of duels, so I hope he can help you, too.”</span>

Atem looked up at the two of them. He took a deep breath. 

&quot;Perhaps looking into the past will not give me the answers I seek. You both...are a future, that I can obtain, that is not uncertain. You both have been...kind to me. Kindness I will not find when I look into a past that does not serve me.&quot;

Yami had started to grip Yugi&#39;s hand a bit tightly. You could tell he was nervous of what Atem was saying. 

&quot;I do not know my circumstances. I do not know what kind of Pharaoh I was, or what my family or friends were like. I have muscle memory of things, perhaps a vague image...but nothing more. But you were the same.&quot; He looked up at Yami. &quot;You did not have a form, a person. You still do not. When we were one in the same, you were a former Pharaoh. But now that we are different, we both lack something. Identity. But you find yourself in him.&quot;

Yami nodded, slowly. He felt himself hold Yugi to his side, a little bit protectively. He wanted Atem to get to the point.

&quot;I want to find myself. But not in the past. I would like to find myself in a future with you both. If you will have me.&quot;</span>

Yugi’s cheeks turned pink. He looked up at Yami.

Yami…found himself in a future with Yugi…and now the two of them were…

Was Atem saying…?

No, he couldn’t put words in Atem’s mouth that weren’t spoken. He couldn’t look for meaning that wasn’t there just because he wanted to see it.

His heart was beating fast. Yugi couldn’t deny what he wanted, though. What he wanted was…

“Of course. A future with you would make me really happy. If that’s what my partner wants too, then…”

He obviously wanted Yami, his partner, at his side. He squeezed Yami’s hand gently. He wanted to keep Yami at his side and never let him go.

But he wanted Atem at his side, too.</span>

And Atem smiled, then, too. He was able to recognize Yami teasing him. Progress, no matter how small. &quot;Thank you both. I know I have not been kind to you. I may still stumble. But all I desire for, now...&quot;

He paused. His mind wandered to the older Atem, the feelings he had felt when they had touched his cheek. How fiercely the older Yami and Yugi loved him. He closed his eyes, as if relieving the sensation. 

&quot;To be with you both. That would be very nice.&quot; It wasn&#39;t the full truth. He wanted to be loved like the two of them, but he wasn&#39;t sure if that was too much. He was already embarrassed about his outbursts the night before, the way he sobbed in front of Yugi. &quot;...Do I get to meet your friends, you think?&quot;</span>

His friends… His friends knew Yami, and they were friends with Yami now, too.

“I don’t see why you can’t meet my friends. I’m sure they’d be happy to meet you. And I’m happy to share them with you, just like I share them with my partner.”</span>

&quot;I- I feel...tired.&quot; He sighed softly. &quot;I-I am not used to...hosting two. I have only ever put my efforts into making you visible.&quot; He yawned, and rubbed his eyes. &quot;I-I am sorry. I wish I could-&quot;

&quot;Then rest with us,&quot; Yami offered. &quot;You have lent me your power. Let me see what I can do for you.&quot; He closed his eyes. While they had the rooms of their minds, Yami was able to pull them somewhere else- he always had. The same place that Yami and Yugi always went to...

&quot;This...looks like Yugi&#39;s bedroom.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Yami sighed. He smiled, glad he could make it happen. He understood what Atem meant about being tired. But he could brave it. Yugi was so <em>happy</em> here. He wanted this for them both so badly. And...maybe that was love. For both of them. &quot;I have learned to bring us here. When we need comfort, or want to connect on a level we cannot in the waking world.&quot; 

Atem was on the bed, where Yugi and Yami had stayed down on the carpet. It was night outside, despite being morning in the waking world. &quot;I...Is it truly alright for me to be here...?&quot;</span>

And he was asleep, sitting up. It was a little bit awkward looking. Yami watched him for a few beats before sighing. &quot;Ohh, Yugi, we are in it now, aren&#39;t we.&quot; He ran a hand through his hair, warmth creeping up his face.</span>

“It’s okay. It’s okay, partner, I promise. We’ll figure this out. I’m not upset.”

Yugi kissed his head again. His affection wasn’t the same as Atem’s, he knew that, but maybe he could make up for the lack of affection just a bit.

“Not Joey,” he agreed. “I don’t need to pretend to have another girlfriend. But I’ll… I’ll try to get advice. We’ll figure this out. I promise.”</span>

&quot;...I must admit I felt a twinge of jealousy, as well.&quot; He laughed weakly. &quot;O-Only playful. I was just reminded how you looked when I would surprise you with affection, and I wanted to- I wanted to be the one to make you have that expression.&quot;

He ran a hand through his own hair again, making it all messy. &quot;I am not even sure who to ask. I do not know if it is wise to ask the older pair of us. They- mm.&quot; He looked at Atem&#39;s sleeping form again. How was he sleeping upright like that...

&quot;They may not enjoy to hear of something they had to miss out on. But...maybe the older Pharaoh...?&quot;</span>

&quot;Oh?&quot; He smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can still make me look like that if you try hard enough. You just have to surprise me, is all.&quot;

He looked down at the Kuriboh, turned it so that it was facing him. Cupped its face with his hands. It stared unblinkingly back at him.

&quot;The older Pharaoh... That&#39;s a good idea. He would probably know better than anyone.&quot; Yugi frowned. &quot;Should we start praying to him? Hope he&#39;ll visit me in another dream? Maybe I should start making pancakes...&quot;</span>

Ahh, but there were greater things at hand. And they had plenty of time for teasing later. First thing they had to sort out was the Pharaoh sleeping so awkwardly- ough, it was starting to bother him. 

Yami got up and carefully approached Atem, slowly guiding his body down to actually <em>lay</em> on the bed to sleep as opposed to sitting upright. When he moved to return next to Yugi, Atem reached out and grabbed Yami&#39;s arm. 

He stilled, a bit of fear striking him. But Atem was still sleeping. His grip was loose. He felt himself flush, glancing back at Yugi. 

&quot;...Y-Yes. We should. As soon as possible.&quot;</span>

There was no structured, formalized words spoken hushed over bread- no, there&#39;s laughter and a bit of embarrassment over misshapen pancakes. 

It reminds him of before. Reminds him of home. So he reaches back out the best he can. This time, they do not wake in a field of sunflowers, rather- the puzzle. Except, it isn&#39;t quite the same as Yugi had seen before. This puzzle is empty. There&#39;s no doors, no stairs...

And no way out, either. 

He seems surprised for a moment to see them awake in this place. But he keeps it to himself. He watches Yami sleep beside Yugi again, and helps Yugi to sit up. 

&quot;You are back,&quot; he says softly. His voice is a little quieter than before, less confident, maybe. &quot;I am sorry I cannot greet you under the sun this time. Circumstances are different for the moment. Do you need something?&quot;</span>

He makes himself smile, even though there is a strange cloud of emotions growing inside of him. &quot;He would tell me that. I suppose I understand.&quot; He laughs a little.

It&#39;s not as bright as his laughs before. 

He glanced at Yugi with a raised brow. &quot;He does not desire to look for his memories?&quot; He hummed, thinking it over. &quot;Interesting. What changed for him, I wonder...&quot;

To be loved, that made sense. Atem could remember the desire himself. The want to be cared for, to be understood...to be free. Thousands of years, alone, degrading inside a puzzle...makes you forget what its like. But there&#39;s a human aspect to it all- at the core of every soul, he thinks, the desire to be loved and to be understood withstands all things. &quot;Well, there must be something more to this. This seems like a positive change. What do you need from me?&quot;</span>

And Atem suddenly wishes they were in the sun. A bumble bee to distract him, the warmth to soothe him, that would help in this moment. But he brings forth all of the power that he can, what little he has left over, and keeps calm. He smiles.

&quot;I won&#39;t ask if you&#39;ve spoken to him about it, because if you are here, evidently...&quot; He laughs. This one is a little better. &quot;But if there is anything I know, you two are not...subtle. He must have an idea of it by now.&quot;

He winks at Yugi. &quot;You&#39;ve always had an issue with blushing. It&#39;s always given you away.&quot;</span>

Yugi hid his face in his hands. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t face the world anymore. 

“He knows?? And he kissed me?? And he— Yami?? And— And— He knows??”

His entire face was the same hue as a tomato by now. Atem knew? Atem already <em>knew</em>? He hadn’t thought of that, he,</span>

He thinks for a moment. It takes a few beats longer than he would like to recall it. &quot;He must recognize that he cares for you, and you care for him. Perhaps, did his &#39;kiss&#39;, look like this?&quot; 

He gestures, tapping his nose. &quot;Touching noses? It was how we depicted love. I always had some vague memories like that. I recall thinking of Yugi-&quot;

He stops. His conversation trail ends there. A memory that had been right there drifted away again. He shook his head. 

&quot;Does he understand romantic love? No, he probably doesn&#39;t know that. If he did, you wouldn&#39;t be sitting here, now would you?&quot; He puts back on a smile. &quot;Tell me what you&#39;ve experienced with him, slowly. You&#39;re going to pass out if you keep breathing like that.&quot; His hand comes to Yugi&#39;s back, then, rubbing a slow, comforting pattern.</span>

He nodded. “He touched noses with me. And then with my partner. And then he saw my partner kiss me on the forehead, and he asked if he could do it, too… and when he did he said it was nice. And-and I liked it, too…”

He took another deep breath. And another.

“He told me, after you helped him, he was worried he was evil. I told him why I didn’t think he was. He told me, when you touched him, he could feel how loved you were. That’s when… I heard him. He wants to be loved, too, like you are. I told him he deserves to be loved. And that’s when he touched noses with me.”

“I was reading a book about Egypt and I saw a picture in it. Touching noses. I asked him about it, and he said it’s something you do for people you care for. He was worried he did something wrong… but we assured him he didn’t. I told him I care for him too, and after that… He touched noses with my partner. Said he wanted him to know he cares for him, too.”

“We visited him inside the puzzle. He was in his room. There was a completely white jigsaw puzzle in there, and he said it appeared after I talked to him the first time. He was trying to solve it, and then he saw Yami kiss me on the forehead, and he wanted to try it, too. So we told him he could and it was…it was really nice.”

“My partner asked him why he couldn’t go in my room, since he said he couldn’t, and he said he wasn’t pure enough to enter… I told him he deserves to have more fun stuff in his room that he likes and not just that maze. He asked us about Duel Monsters, so I got my deck and showed it to him. He liked the Kuriboh card my partner treasures, because I gave it to him as a gift. He saw Dark Magician and said he looks familiar… But he couldn’t remember. And that’s when he said… He didn’t know what waited for him in his memories, but me and my partner are kind, so he wants to find himself in a future with us.”

He took another deep breath.

“He asked if he could meet our friends. Then he said he was tired, so we took him to our inner world. And we let him rest there.”

He giggled. “My partner told me after that, when Atem kissed my forehead… he was jealous Atem didn’t ask to kiss him, too. We both like him. We just… We don’t know if he feels the same way…”</span>

This was all good things he was being told, Yugi was telling him great things in fact. So why was he feeling so...<em>sour</em> about it? He knew it was irrational...but there was something else there. 

<em>Why</em> was he feeling this way? He hated that he couldn&#39;t <em>remember.</em> 

But he knew this was good. He knew it was something he wanted for them. And it was a version of himself. He could put himself back in those shoes. 

&quot;My, my...Now isn&#39;t that a puzzle,&quot; he laughed softly. &quot;There are things we know for sure. He liked giving you affection, and you liked receiving it. You and Yami both know that your feelings align about him. And he is...well, he is very incapable of lying. Trust me on this one.&quot;

<em>Why trust you? You lied to him all the time. Like you did before.</em> Before what? Atem shook the thought off. &quot;His awareness is so thin, so to speak. He only knows what you have shown him, and his experiences...and a bit of his anger.&quot;

He paused. He realized something then, and laughed. &quot;Would you like to know why he thinks Dark Magician is familiar? Dark Magician was a friend of mine. His name was Mahad. Images of him are what inspired the card...&quot;

He smiled. &quot;That means he is beginning to remember in his own way. You must make him feel safe to try and remember. That is a good step. But...in the end, you&#39;ll need to speak with him. Explain yourself, what you mean. He is thoughtful, and will begin to understand. You share a heart, a mind- after a while, you will not be able to hide it, haha.&quot;

He glanced down. Yami seemed to stir, a little. Something flashed across his face, but passed again.</span>

He sighed. “We’ll have to talk to him… I never got the courage to tell Yami about my feelings first. He found the words before I found my courage. Talking to him is going to take a lot of courage… But at least this time, I won’t be alone.”

Yugi looked down at his partner with a smile. His partner had the words, now, and the two of them could talk to Atem together. They would get through this.

He hoped.

“I’m not sure I know how to explain it to him, but…we’ll do our best.”</span>

&quot;Is he-?&quot; He whispered, shifting to look him over. Yami&#39;s free hand came up to his head, taking a fistful of hair and gripping it tightly. He looked like he was in pain. 

Something seemed to click for Atem, and his expression paled slightly. &quot;Ah- hm. P-Perhaps it is time for you to wake up.&quot;</span>

&quot;Ah. Thank god. They woke up.&quot;

And the room as empty again. He sighed out his slight anxiety, and pulled his knees up to his chest, resting his head there. 

...What had he just been doing again?

--

Yami woke with a start, choking on his breath like he had been drowning. He seemed far away again, confused on where he was and what was going on. He hadn&#39;t woken up controlling the body this time, thankfully. But the urge to pull on their hair was strong, like he wanted to will the body to do it anyway. His thoughts were alarm and unknown things, spoken in languages that didn&#39;t sound like anything they&#39;d ever heard before. 

A nightmare? Again? Yami thought making peace with Atem was going to soothe this problem...</span>

Right now, everything with Atem was secondary to him. Yami needed his help.

“Partner? Partner, I’m here. Are you okay??”

Yugi wrapped his arms around himself in a way he hoped would be comforting to Yami. He looked around, trying to find him.</span>

He pushed the balls of his hands into his eyes and tried to regulate his breaths, shaking his head. He was thinking in things he didn&#39;t understand. He tried to say something but when it came out, it wasn&#39;t right. Some language that neither of them knew. 

He shook his head. Tried to ground himself more, tried to lift his hands to look at Yugi. But he found it difficult, his eyes playing tricks on him again. <em>Pharaoh,</em> he whispered, looking at Yugi. He wasn&#39;t seeing things correctly. He spoke again and it was wrong, not understandable. 

<strong>He&#39;s asking for help.</strong> Came a quiet, flat voice. <strong>He&#39;s speaking Egyptian, I think. It sounds familiar to me.</strong>

Atem did not appear, putting his efforts into letting Yami have as physical form as he could. Instead he just existed as a voice inside Yugi&#39;s mind.</span>

Yugi wasn’t sure what happened in Yami’s nightmare, but a really bad picture was being painted for him. Being hunted, abandonment…

“He must have abandoned me in his nightmare,” he whispered. He focused back on Yami again, his voice louder now. “It’s okay partner. I’m right here. You didn’t abandon me, it was just a nightmare… You’re okay. We’re both okay, my love.”</span>

He didn&#39;t want to go back to resting himself until he could make Yami calm. 

Atem willed himself into Yugi&#39;s hands, making them slowly move up and cup either side of Yami&#39;s face. Yami lowered his arms, looking confused. Atem pushed Yugi in closer, so they were touching noses. Just like he had done to them. 

And after a few beats, it looked like he started to come back to himself. His eyes focused back in. <em>Y...Yugi.</em> He breathed. <em>Where- where am...I-? Our room,</em> he didn&#39;t move, looking up into Yugi&#39;s eyes. They were all he needed to see, to keep him tethered here. <em>Something terrible was h-happening. I heard your voice.

Angry voices, saying Yami abandoned him, a voice that sounded like an older Yugi…

“The other Pharaoh… They do love him. But he found his memories. And after he found his memories, he left. Went to the afterlife,” Yugi explained gently. “The other Yugi and Yami miss him a lot… And it sounds like he misses them, too…”

It seemed like the older Atem was speaking through Yami, or something like that. Yugi wasn’t entirely sure. 

He reached out to cup his partner’s face with his hand. “It’s okay, partner. If you need to get the words out, you can. I think he’s trying to speak through you, or something like that.”</span>

Atem isn&#39;t fast enough on the uptick and misses words here and there- and besides, his knowledge of what he&#39;s saying is rough at best. 

<strong>Something about being punished for visiting. Forgetting again...</strong> Atem&#39;s voice becomes a little thin. He doesn&#39;t like what he&#39;s hearing. <strong>He says- I- I don&#39;t want to say it. I-I&#39;m sorry.</strong>

Atem appears then, his form hovering over Yami. He takes his hands and pulls them from his head, and Yami stops talking again, looks at him. Atem thinks, he should do something to shock him out of this, maybe? He wracks his brain for some options. He just cannot listen to him talk anymore, not in those words, and if he just does something with his mouth and- ah-ha!

Atem leans down and kisses him, taking the words from his mouth. He stays there until Yami squirms from lack of breath. And when they part, Yami is <em>definitely</em> awake, looking at Atem with wide eyes and a flush that makes his form glow pink in the night. <strong>You are no longer talking. That is good.</strong> Atem breaths, and then his form disappears, muttering about his own exhaustion again.</span>

They needed to talk to Atem— They— They really needed to talk to Atem—

Focus. They could talk to Atem later. Right now, Yami needed help, and Atem had disappeared and Yugi needed to provide that help.

Yugi leaned down and kissed Yami on the forehead. “Are you okay, partner? This is— This must be really scary for you. I’m not going anywhere, I’m staying right here.”</span>

Yami covers his face again, but this time its to try and mitigate the blush. Which isn&#39;t helping. He&#39;s physically glowing pink. <em>P-Please tell me whatever you h-heard from the Pharaoh was good advice.</em></span>

Atem just kissed Yami on the mouth— On the <em>mouth</em> — and Yugi kind of wanted a kiss, too— wait, what?

N-no, he needed to stay focused.

Atem kissed Yami on the mouth??

The Pharaoh, right, the Pharaoh’s advice. The advice the Pharaoh gave. The Pharaoh’s advice from his dream hat he had after they prayed to him for advice.

“He— He gave me good advice,” Yugi told him. “He— He confirmed that touching noses is how they depicted love, he probably doesn’t understand romantic love, he… He said we should talk to him. Explain what we feel. He said we should speak from the heart.”

Yugi sighed. “He said he’d understand if we explain. We just— We really need to talk to him. Especially after…that.”

Did ancient Egyptian Pharaohs platonically kiss people on the mouth?? Was that something they did??</span>

After praying to the even older version of that spirit for guidance about this spirit and- 

<em>We have to talk to him. As soon as possible. In fact I would consider waking him up right now. Immediately.</em> He moved his hands to look at Yugi. <em>We can deal with whatever strange nightmares I&#39;m having <strong>after</strong> we deal with t-this. I think.

Atem murmured something himself in the same language, and fussed with the sleeves of the pajamas he was mimicking from Yugi. <strong>You both care for me as if I were...a &quot;partner&quot;, you would call it?</strong> 

Yami wheezed out a breath and nodded. Maybe that was good, maybe that meant whatever came out of his mouth made sense. And was good. 

<strong>...What brought this on? You just had a nightmare- why are we fussing about me?</strong> He asked simply, though his cheeks were a soft red. He hadn&#39;t said anything...<em>negative</em> yet. Just quite a bit of confusion.</span>

One finger at a time, he tapped each fingertip of his hands together. From his thumb, to his pinky, then back to his thumb. He watched his hands the entire time.

&quot;You&#39;ve kissed both of us-- And that&#39;s not a bad thing! We like it! But it&#39;s not something &#39;roommates&#39; would typically do, or even friends. It&#39;s something usually partners would do. A-and we just want to be sure-- Do you feel the same way about us? It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t! We just want to know...&quot;

Part of Yugi badly wanted Atem to say he felt the same. The other part was fully convinced Atem only wanted to be friends and was ready to push his feelings down for however long it took to get rid of them.</span>

Atem&#39;s brow nits together, thinking over what was said to him. Yami is finally starting to breathe again, and he reaches out to take Yugi&#39;s hand tightly. There&#39;s a lot happening. This is the start of many conversations, he knows this, but-

<strong>Those are-</strong> He says the word again, in Egyptian. <strong>Er- I- hm.</strong> 

His flush hasn&#39;t died down. He seems to be struggling to figure out how to say what he wants to say, and he keeps starting and stopping. 

<strong>Yami and I were one, for a long time. When he felt strongly for you, as did I. I guided his actions, and he guided mine. He fell for you when you were in that terrible place, that- amusement park.</strong>

Yami flushed, nodded. <em>Death-T.</em>

<strong>When you told your friends of your condition. When you allowed him to help you, even though you both were still on different terms...Even though you feared him. I was a spirit with no name, no face, no identity. And you...</strong>

Atem wriggled in place. His hands gestured. Yami realized he was wishing for a deck of cards in his hands, like Yami would fuss with. <strong>You loved me-us-<em>him</em> the same. Perhaps some of my...reactions...have been...born of...jealousy.</strong> 

Yami blinks. His frantic fears are fading and now he&#39;s focused on the person in front of him. So much like himself, and yet different. Standing on the edge of new life. <em>You were upset. When you began wanting to find your memories, and I did not, Yugi&#39;s care turned to me, over you.</em>

<strong>I did not think either of you liked me. Let alone...loved me. I thought the possibility only existed as...&#39;roommates&#39; of sorts, as I said.</strong> 

<em>...So you care for Yugi as I do?</em>

Atem nodded. Yami glanced at Yugi, as if to ask, does that answer it?</span>

Yami had liked him since…since Death-T?

His face turned bright red. <em>Yami and Atem</em> had <em>both</em> liked him since Death-T.

He turned towards Atem again. “You…you like me?” His heart was trying to leap out of his chest. “I… I said before. I loved you both when I thought you were the same. But you’re not, and now that I know that…that hasn’t changed. I still love you… Both of you…”

He leaned over to kiss Atem on the cheek. “You don’t have to be jealous, Atem. I do love you.”

He hesitated. “And you…you love Yami, too?”</span>

<strong>Yami and I...mm.</strong> He looked to him, and Yami forced himself to maintain his look back. <strong>You and I were one and the same. And in some ways, we brought the worst out in each other. We fed each other&#39;s rage, confusion...loneliness.</strong>

Yami blew a breath out through his nose, and nodded. Atem was right, whether he liked it or not. <strong>To love you is to forgive. To forgive the things I was, and the things that I may never be.</strong>

A lump started to form in Yami&#39;s throat. Atem was so...serious. Heartfelt. And damnit, he was right. <em>And I, you. To forgive the identity I never had, and the pain I caused along the way.</em>

Shyly, Atem reached out and took Yami&#39;s hand. Yami held it back gently, easily. Suddenly the contact felt good, instead of jumpy, like razor wire.

<em>...Yes, Yugi. In case it was not clear. He does love me, too.</em> Yami smiled at his partner, leaning to kiss his cheek.</span>

“We all love each other… We love each other…”

He was happy. So, so happy. Happy tears threatened to overtake him, but he forced them back. He didn’t want to cry. 

“We all love each other, so… Everything’s okay. We can be happy together…”

He kissed Yami on the cheek. Then he leaned over and kissed Atem on the cheek, too. There was so much room in his heart for love for both of them, so much affection he was happy to give the both of them.</span>

There were still unknowns, but, for now the world felt right. Better than it felt in weeks, since the spirit of the puzzle- since Atem, had started to rebel against them. Now there wasn&#39;t a need for it. 

And Yami suddenly smirked, like an idea had come over him. He leaned over to Atem, and whispered in his ear. Atem listened, nodding, and then Yami disappeared for a moment. Which made Atem&#39;s form a bit more solid. 

Atem shifted forward, draping his arms around Yugi&#39;s shoulders. <strong>He told me, that your thoughts are loud. And that I should make things even.</strong> He said it simply, like he didn&#39;t fully understand what Yami meant, but trusted him on this one. 

He leaned down and pressed a kiss to Yugi&#39;s lips, not parting again until the other squirmed for air. It was weird how <em>real</em> it felt now that Atem and Yami were working together, their abilities not fractured between them. 

Then, he pressed their foreheads together, gently brushing noses. His eyes were half lidded, and he murmured something in Egyptian again, softly. Whatever it was sounded affectionate.</span>

Yugi squeaked as he was kissed, his face turned bright red. He returned the kiss once he got over his initial shock, staying like that for as long as he could. After they parted, he panted for air, forced himself to breathe as they touched noses. His face was still very red. 

That was-- really-- Wow--

&quot;He... You...&quot; Yugi struggled to get more than a few words out at a time. Even his thoughts were at a standstill. &quot;You both-- You teamed up-- against me...&quot;

As accusatory as the words themselves were, he didn&#39;t sound upset about it. Surprised, sure, but he was nowhere near unhappy. That felt so <em>real</em>, and it was so <em>nice</em>, and...

And that was about how coherent his thoughts could be, at the moment.</span>

There&#39;s a soft laughter, and Yami returns, unable to hide the smile on his face. Yes, this was good. His fears about being jealous were definitely gone. Seeing his partner so happy and cute was all he needed, anything for him. And it made the nightmare further way. 

Hell, the nightmare was worth it if it meant getting to see Yugi so happy. <em>It&#39;s very late. We have school in the morning, don&#39;t we?</em>

<strong>Ah- I am sorry. I did not-</strong>

<em>You do not have to apologize, Atem.</em> His words were a bit firm. But Atem seemed to relax, even though Yami&#39;s tone was a bit sharper than he may have taken with Yugi. <em>It was my nightmare that woke us up. And that is not my fault, either. It just is.</em>

Yami pecked Yugi&#39;s cheek, and then Atem&#39;s. Hm. He liked doing that, too. This was much less worrisome than he thought it would be. Yami smiled at Yugi&#39;s daze, pulling him back down to lay down. Atem looked a little lost, and Yami gestured for him to follow. Thank god the two of them were still slightly incorporeal, or else they&#39;d never all fit on Yugi&#39;s single bed. But they did- and the two of them, nearly atop each other and Yugi, were warm. 

<em>Can you sleep again like this, Yugi, or are you going to short-circuit again?</em> Another laugh.</span>

Right, there was school in the morning...

&quot;I can-- I can sleep like this!&quot; Okay, maybe he was short-circuiting a little. But he didn&#39;t want Atem and Yami to leave him. He just wanted the three of them to stay like this, to be together until they fell asleep... &quot;I can sleep...&quot;

He closed his eyes. Wrapped his arms around both Yami and Atem. Despite his brain short-circuiting, it didn&#39;t take him long to fall asleep.</span>

<em>...Something is wrong, isn&#39;t it.</em> He whispered. 

<strong>You were speaking a language only I should know.</strong>

<em>I did not have control over that.</em> Yami forces himself still, despite the fact he wants to squirm under Atem&#39;s eyes. They&#39;re both trying to piece it together. 

<strong>I will not allow whatever it is to harm him.</strong> Yami glances down at Yugi, then back at Atem. 

<em>...No matter what,</em> he agrees, quietly. <strong>No matter the cost.</strong>

They both fall to sleep as well, eventually. And it is dreamless, quiet, uninterrupted.</span>
