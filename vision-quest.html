Rockman blinked again, and he saw Searchman in Blues&#39; place. Featureless, voiceless, a green haze. He blinked again and Blues lost his features, he was simply a red silhouette- save for the thin, missing part, just where his neck would be. Whatever had just happened- it felt <em>good.</em> But it was severely tiring. &quot;You- you, and Searchman. Hazy.

&quot;Searchman?&quot; Blues cocked his head a little and ended up colliding with Rock&#39;s hand. That felt good. He calmed a little, even though he was terribly worried. 

&quot;Your father should take another look at you.&quot;  He reached up to hold Rockman&#39;s hand. &quot;You cannot see my...?&quot; His other hand touched his own features as if to make sure they were still there. Stranger glitches had happened.</span>

That was a good idea- though, as always, the suggestion of hypnosis made his heart flutter. Lots of good memories were attached to the activity. 
&quot;Y-Yeah, ah...That&#39;d be helpful. I think.&quot; He was willing to try anything- and, anything to get his aching body to relax. Exhaustion had a way of taking him out, nearly completely.</span>

Rockman&#39;s head leaned into Blues&#39; hand, who was now the phantom&#39;s hand- four of them, on his shoulders and his neck, his face. He could identify them as false visions of both Blues and Searchman- but why them?
He knew what they were saying, but it wasn&#39;t as if he heard them- they had no voice, the two of them. &quot;Have you heard of the story,&quot; they said seemingly in unison, &quot;of the humans made with four arms and legs...and two heads? The Gods were angered at their power...and split them. They wasted away trying to find their other halves..&quot;
&quot;Do you think,&quot; only one seemed to muse, &quot;Alpha Navis were once that way?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rockman breathed this both out loud and in the vision. Yet this was knowledge he couldn&#39;t have known- yet, somehow, he felt the answer was right.
&quot;It&#39;s a shame...&quot; They whispered to him, &quot;That we had to be split.&quot;
Rockman&#39;s eyes fluttered, still under yet- he looked up at Blues...
And his right eye flashed with words.
[SPLIT]
[TOGETHER]
[TRIO]</span>

He memorized the words there. Blues secured them, and the whole scene into his memory banks. 

&quot;Rock-? Rockman.&quot; He spoke firmly, but felt like he wasn&#39;t being heard. Rock&#39;s blankeness along with this made him worried-- he should have been responding at least a little. &quot;You are going to wake, and tell me what you have seen, in 1...2...3....&quot;</span>

But they faded. Rockman blinked twice and his eyes returned to their usual emerald.
&quot;Ah...&quot; The way his eyes made minute focuses appeared overtly mechanical. &quot;I...They were telling some...story...&quot;
It felt like a dream quickly slipping from his memory. He stayed still where he was. &quot;Some old story about...humans...And how, uh...two people...used to share a body and...They said it was sad, that...they were split? I- I don&#39;t know. Darn it, that wasn&#39;t-&quot;

Wow, it was really weird to casually namedrop him. But he had grown to be the least of anyone&#39;s worries at the present moment.

He stared up at the frankly much too large arachny, dragging a foot back to steady himself- that was clearly his own movements (as Blues often chastised him for the movement- too much noise and drag). He drew his active sword back, tipping on his heels and lunging, attempting to cut Blues away. 
The virus swung and used Blues to swat Rockman off course. Rockman tumbled and groaned, slow to drag himself off the ground. 
The arachny dragged Blues up, wrapping him up further in the sticky silk- so that, when its fangs dug into his armor and pierced through, he wouldn&#39;t squirm and break free. 
When Rockman got on his feet and moved to charge the beast again, he felt himself <em>growl</em> when he saw it hurt Blues. A wave of pain flushed over him, red hot venom dominating his senses for a moment. He didn&#39;t react to it right away. &quot;Blues-!&quot; 
His voice came out choked- the pain flooded through. He blinked hard, realizing the strangeness of it all. He touched his shoulder- and data came away in the same way Blues&#39; did.</span>

Blues couldn&#39;t feel or see the damage, but his diagnostic warnings told him the chunk taken out was significant. The fangs tore out the right side of his chest armor, and heat filled Blues&#39; body. That, he could feel. 

Hot weakness started infecting his data with bugs and error messages. He struggled harder, to give his swords purchase.</span>

Muramasa in hand. Swiftly he spun and cut through the monster, once twice and a third time to cut down the silk running down Blues&#39; back. He was in an autopilot- eyes burning a bright, brilliant blue. The virus screeched, and Rockman assured it was swiftly taken care of- a third slice, and it was over. The globs of silk faded away in pixels along with the arachny itself. 
Rockman stood there, still- chest heaving. He felt the familiar pull of muramasa return to him- for a moment, it had felt like an extension of him, but now it was cemented in his hand, feeding off of him.</span>

Blues held out his hand, anticipating his navi symbol to shift and grant him the power. Instead, he was laying on the ground, and Mura Masa was tugging him to his feet. 

Blues crawled over, and reached up to the pulling. His body was again barely his own, as he rose and placed his hands on Rockman&#39;s. Energy flowed between them like he had not felt before. He pried Rockman&#39;s frozen hands free, and palmed the sword away.

They jacked out at a proper warp point, and collapsed in Blues&#39; PET. 

&quot;Here, here--&quot; Blues wheezed, and fell to his knees. Poison data was still creating bugs across his code. It was a miracle he could even run here.</span>
