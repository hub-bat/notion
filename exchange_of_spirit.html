What did all this mean? Different dimensions? Electronic mail? None of it made any sense to him.

“If this is Kaiba’s idea of a joke, then it isn’t funny.”

But what if it wasn’t a joke? Everyone else in that chatroom seemed to take it all seriously, and had some idea what that admin guy was talking about. If that was the case, Yugi was in way over his head. He didn’t understand any of this stuff. 

The others mentioned getting their decks ready. He probably should work on his. Yugi reached to pick up his own deck and looked down at it. How long had it been since they worked on it? He couldn’t remember.

Speaking of they…

“What do you think of all this, partner?”

Upon saying the word ‘partner’, Yugi could feel his heart try to leap out of his chest. Yeah, partners. They were partners… It was hard not to smile at the thought. Just the word itself made him happy.

Okay, Yugi, come on, focus. Crazy dimension stuff. Deck building. Electronic mail. This was important, he couldn’t be distracted.</span>

His smile and emotion were more than just seen- with their bond, it was felt. <em>&quot;Good work, partner.&quot;</em>

He glanced at the computer. What a weird device. Other people were inside of it? It confused him just as much as Kaiba&#39;s other technology. But, he could never hope to understand it all. He would just stick by Yugi, who seemed to understand it better than him.</span>

Wait, Yami said other words besides that. He tried to focus on those.

“M-more spells, huh?” That was a good idea. He stood up to get his cards that weren’t in his deck to look through. “I think we have more spells we can look through. As for what’s new, Grandpa’s probably got a bunch of newer stuff we can look at in the shop.” He paused, his brain taking an entirely new train of thought. “With the game getting more popular, do you think Grandpa’s been getting more business?”</span>

That was nice. It meant they could be closer-

<em>&quot;The shop?&quot;</em> Yami paused, looking thoughtful. <em>&quot;If Grandpa considered carrying more, perhaps. He has lower stock than most places.&quot;</em> He peeked at the door, half expecting him to break it down and scold them for speaking poorly of the store. When that didn&#39;t happen, he continued. <em>&quot;While I agree with the sentiment that there are other games just as good as Duel Monsters, one cannot ignore it&#39;s popularity.&quot;</em> 

When Yugi returned, Yami reached out as if to take the binder from him. When he brushed against Yugi&#39;s hand and felt its almost transparency, he laughed. <em>&quot;I always forget. Will you show me, partner?&quot;</em></span>

He opened the binder and very slowly flipped through it, trying to give each card careful consideration. It was hard to concentrate. How could one little touch be so distracting?

His brain tried to latch onto something, anything, to think about other than Yami’s hand brushing against his. It was so difficult with Yami so close to him. His heart was beating so fast. 

“I wonder what our friends would think of all this… This multiple d-dimension stuff seems so far-fetched!” He laughed again, though he wasn’t entirely sure why. He really was trying to act normal! But with Yami right here and so close…</span>

He raised his hand again, like he was going to press it to Yugi&#39;s forehead, but lowered before he made the contact. Remembering that wasn&#39;t how things worked. <em>&quot;You appear flushed. Are you sick?&quot;</em>

Yami didn&#39;t feel sick. But he supposed that could be the case- one of them feeling sick, and the other not. Discordant emotions had happened before. He closed his eyes for a brief moment. 

<em>&quot;Your heart is racing, partner.&quot;</em> He opened his eyes again. <em>&quot;Perhaps we should take a break, if you are not feeling well.&quot;</em></span>

Why did he have to be so nervous? This wasn’t the first time Yami had ever called him partner, or made contact, or been concerned about him.  The only thing that was different now was all the chaotic emotion swirling inside him.

“I-I’m fine! Really! You don’t need to worry!” Yugi shook his head. “I can keep going, really!” He pointed to a random card in the binder. “What do you think of this one? Could be good for our deck, right?”</span>

This time, even though the contact was moot, Yami put his hand over Yugi&#39;s, trying to impress upon him his concern. This was normal in his eyes- he was trying to be a good friend, like Yugi had taught him!</span>

“I’m not sick! I-I’m okay, really!” And it wasn’t a lie; he really wasn’t sick. But the real reason he was acting this way… he didn’t have the courage to say it. He couldn’t do it.

He laughed again. “Of course! Just t-trying to keep you on your toes!” He looked away, just looking at Yami was too much for him right now.</span>

He started breathing faster. He couldn’t do this.

Yugi jumped out of his seat and ran. Out of his room, out of the shop.</span>

Well, if it had been nothing before, it was something now. From the alley beside the shop came a larger man who grabbed Yugi as soon as he was outside, pulling him back into the dark.

Yugi stayed hidden behind his other self, even though the man wouldn’t be able to see him. He could feel his other self’s confidence and determination, and it felt comforting. Like a blanket over his shoulders. He knew Yami knew what he was doing. Everything was going to be okay. He could believe that now.</span>

It was a 16. Not a great hand. He was willing to take a chance, though. 

&quot;Hit,&quot; he said, looking at the man. The gun was a worry some point...but it was in his control. He had everything together. <em>Don&#39;t worry, partner. I will protect us.</em></span>

The man flipped over his second card. Less than 17, so that was an automatic draw. He scowled at the sight of his next card. That put him over 21. Damn.

He was so close to winning this game, so close to getting all the cards he desired and more! He couldn’t afford to lose!

He gathered up the cards and put them on the bottom of the deck. He held the deck low as he prepared to start shuffling. As he did so, he carefully, subtly, made sure to drop the bottom few cards on the deck to the floor. There. That should lower this kid’s chances of another 21.

He shuffled and dealt the cards.</span>

It wasn’t a pretty sight. But, Yugi had a hard time feeling too bad for the man after having a gun shoved in his face. A little bad, sure, but not too much.

———

Back in his room, Yugi couldn’t stop shaking. Tears threatened to spill from his eyes. Guilt ate at him, for nearly getting his grandpa’s store robbed, for getting into a situation where his partner had to protect him. For not simply telling the truth.

But, his partner <em>had</em> protected him, and they were both okay. He was extremely grateful.

But the whole thing was his fault. Yugi couldn’t deny that.</span>

He trusted him. His partner trusted him. He felt like he betrayed that trust today, but it didn’t changed the fact that Yami trusted him. 

“I’ll tell you someday. I promise.” Once he worked up the courage. However long that took.

It <em>was</em> late, wasn’t it? Exhaustion hit him like a train. He reached out towards Yami. “Please stay here with me. Please don’t go.”</span>

He folded his legs, sitting on the edge of Yugi&#39;s bed. He watched the window, like he was staking out for them. He could wait. 

Even if it made him very, very curious. But Yugi was a fun kind of curiosity- one that made his heart feel less jaded and lost. Yugi was a kind of home. No matter if it was confusing or scary or <em>anything.</em> Yugi would always be his way home. 

<em>&quot;Relax. I&#39;ll keep you safe.&quot;</em></span>

…Yugi hoped he could work up the courage soon. Yami deserved better than to have secrets held from him. Maybe he should talk to Anzu…

Holding back a yawn, Yugi jumped out of bed. He grabbed pajamas and quickly changed into them, leaving his clothes on the floor for now. He could take care of them after he rested.

As he approached his bed once more, Yugi paused for a moment. He smiled. “Thanks, partner. For everything.”</span>

He was so tired the ‘dear’ slipped right by him. It just sounded right, natural. Tomorrow, when he remembered it, though, he’d feel like he was exploding all over again.

Once he was in bed and comfortable, he closed his eyes. Without thinking about it, he held up a hand against his heart as he fell into slumber.</span>

He couldn&#39;t possibly show any of this yet. He was already scaring Yugi with his advances in the first place. They had no intention, but-! 

Silent groan. 

Whoever he used to be, he wondered if that person struggled this much with feelings too. Or maybe the person he was now was just an idiot.
