“No.” He looked back up at Yami. “He was nice. He could be a friend, and he reminded me a bit of you, but… He’s not you. He’s not my partner, who has been at my side this whole time, who has protected me from danger and shared my greatest victories with me. He doesn’t compare.”

He leaned over and kissed Yami on the cheek. “<em>You’re</em> the one that I love, partner. That hasn’t changed, and it never will.”</span>

He even let himself laugh a little. <em>&quot;I-I am sorry. I know that was a bit silly of me. They- they simply spoke of him so highly, and...seeing, the...other &#39;me&#39;...</em>

He shook his head. <em>I was feeling odd. Their life...Even though they described such hardship...It seemed...mundane. Safe.</em> Safe. That was what he truly was caught on. If he was a danger, if being together like this was a danger to Yugi...?

And it spelled strange feelings for Yami&#39;s own identity. <em>The older me described believing he was the spirit of the puzzle...I believed I was as well. But- now that...must not be the case. I am someone else. And the pull of the puzzle was never...a part of me.</em>

He looked down at the puzzle again. <em>Then...Who am I? And what do we do of this spirit? If we keep fighting it...What if it continues to harm you?</em>

Unwillingly, the deck in his hands started to flash a familiar suite- hearts and spades. It wasn&#39;t something he had full control over, showing where his mind was leading to.</span>

He leaned backwards a bit, looking his partner in the eye. “They said you’re not the spirit of the puzzle, that you’re a part of me… But no matter what, you’re my partner. We’ll figure out who you are, and we’ll figure it out together. I will not leave you to figure this out alone. We’re a team.”

He wrapped a hand around the puzzle. “The spirit of the puzzle… I’d play any number of shadow games against him to keep you at my side, but I don’t want him to hurt you anymore… But I couldn’t stand to part with the puzzle and lose our connection, either.

He looked at his cards again. Fanned them out, back in. Tried the swing cuts again. They were better this time. 

<em>&quot;You prevented me from hurting Kaiba. I was ready to harm him. Ready to win by any means necessary. And I did not understand why you stopped me. I...If I am honest, I was angry with you. I thought that working for what we were fighting for meant doing anything and everything. Even if that meant hurting someone who did not deserve it.&quot;</em>

He managed to roll one of the packets of cards over his index fingers, and then back. 

<em>&quot;You were afraid of me. Spirit of the puzzle or not. I was angry, I was wrathful. I was taking your memories and I was harming others in this attempt to protect you.&quot;</em>

He looked back up at Yugi. 

<em>&quot;I only learned to be gentle through you. Our battle with Pegasus. I realized...I needed someone to balance me out. And every day, you remind me of that. That we are stronger together.&quot;</em>

He reached out and put his hand over Yugi&#39;s, over the puzzle. <em>&quot;If you can teach me, <strong>we</strong> can teach them to be kind. I may be hurt in the process...But all good things come with a bit of pain, I believe.&quot;</em></span>

…It was easy to forget how scared he used to be of Yami. Yugi didn’t like to think about it. He loved his partner so much, he was ashamed of that fear. But he couldn’t hide from the truth.

He did used to be afraid of Yami. But now they were partners with an unbreakable bond. And they were stronger together. So, maybe, the spirit of the puzzle… Maybe they could create a strong bond with him, too.

Whether he would love the spirit of the puzzle, the way the older Yugi and Yami loved their Atem… That remained to be seen.

“We’ll teach him together, partner. And I’ll do everything I can to protect you from being hurt. Just like I know you’ll protect me.”

He leaned forward again, pressed another kiss to Yami’s cheek. “If I really was able to teach you to be gentle…then nothing makes me happier. <em>No one</em> makes me happier than you, partner. We balance each other out perfectly.”</span>

Even if the puzzle was here for different reasons, it was clear he was supposed to be here, with Yugi. That, he knew to be true, no matter what else happened. He looked down at the puzzle again.

On it was a picture of someone who looks like me, and there was Dark Magician fighting against a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. He said in a past life that was me, that I was a Pharaoh.

He looked back up at Yami. “The spirit put himself in the puzzle to stop something bad from happening. His name is the seal keeping him in the puzzle. He doesn’t remember his name…and that’s why he’s trapped in there.”

And now, Yugi knew that name.</span>

He suddenly felt a knot untie in his heart. He blinked, looked down at the puzzle. What was that-? He hadn&#39;t realized there had been some tension on his soul, and now that it was suddenly gone...

<em>&quot;...Something changed,&quot;</em> He murmured. <em>&quot;Now that I&#39;ve heard what the tablet contains...It seems like, it&#39;s fine, now. I do not feel this weight in my heart, like I have felt since this began.&quot;</em> 

And behind it, he felt...hope? <em>&quot;I...feel as though it&#39;s trying to communicate with me. I can feel emotions that are not mine.&quot;</em>

He still wasn&#39;t completely solid, but his presence was a lot stronger than Yami&#39;s. He reached forward and grabbed the puzzle, able to pull the chain and look at it closely. It was probably a bit too harsh, but it seemed like he was only just getting used to using this power.

But, strangely enough, he let go of the puzzle. He folded his arms and looked away from Yugi. He didn&#39;t immediately jump at the chance to use Yugi, to get him to do what he wanted. 

<em>&quot;...What did he tell you,&quot;</em> he asked quietly. He didn&#39;t look at him. <em>&quot;I just want to know.&quot;</em>

And he did suddenly look like them- look like a kid, stuck here and confused. There was still annoyance in his expression, but it was still Yami&#39;s face. Yugi could likely see the ways it showed his underlying upset.

“He spoke to you…?”

Underneath all that anger and annoyance…the Pharaoh was still a person. He thought back to the older Yami’s words. Being trapped in a prison without knowing the crime committed. Yugi would be scared in that situation, and the Pharaoh probably was, too.

“He told me…I was you, in a past life. That you sealed yourself in the puzzle to stop something bad from happening. He told me…” 

Yugi stared at his hands. They were still shaking. 

“That your name is the seal trapping you in the puzzle.”</span>

Did it matter now, what he thought? He was wrong, about the whole situation. Yami and the Pharaoh were two different people.

“And… And you would leave, too, and… the older me misses the older you so much. He loves him. I don’t…”

He looked up again, reached out to hold the Pharaoh’s hand.

“I <em>do</em> want to help you! Just not…not in a way where I lose my partner… They said we could learn to coexist. That me and my partner, we could help you learn to be gentle and kind, and… I’d like that. To coexist with you…”</span>

And maybe it had been in a long, long time. 

<em>&quot;Coexist,&quot;</em> he mumbled. He looked down at their joined hands. <em>&quot;...But that means staying trapped. And- and you both...you hate me. Him, especially.

It was clear he didn&#39;t trust the idea, didn&#39;t have much reason to. His only experiences with the two of them were violent, and met with heavy resistance.

He’s not evil, so I don’t believe you are, either.” He held the puzzle with his free hand. “I can’t get rid of the puzzle… It helps my partner and I connect. We wouldn’t be able to see each other like this without it. It’s selfish, but… I couldn’t stand to lose what my partner and I have. Which means I have to keep the puzzle.”</span>

He looked at the puzzle again. Seemed lost in his thoughts, his expression unreadable. Then his hand loosened, as if in reaction to Yugi&#39;s touch. Again, like it was foreign to him. 

<em>&quot;Whatever power afforded to me by the puzzle...allows this projection.

He didn&#39;t say anything for a while. <em>&quot;...Do I at least get to learn my name? I have no memories of being a Pharaoh. I have no memories of being anyone. Something-&quot;</em> He shook his head. <em>&quot;I would like something to hold onto, at least.&quot;</em></span>

What should he do? His name was the seal. What would happen if he told him? Maybe nothing would happen. Maybe the worst would happen.

But… Yugi was taking so much away from him. Taking away his chance at freedom. Taking away his memories. He deserved something. He deserved better. Yugi was being so selfish, and…

“Your name…”

He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t condemn this person to be trapped in the puzzle without even knowing his own name.

And the response, <em>Nothing- we just spoke-</em>

On the outside, Atem seemed to tense up, his brow knitting together. 

<em>If I must tolerate you, then you will not harm him! You will not trick me, you will not force us to do your bidding! I will not let you take him away! <strong>I will not be a servant to a king!</strong></em>

When he came to, he gasped for air, like he had been drowning. The force his hand had was gone, back to being much weaker, just a warmth. Yami turned to Yugi immediately.

“He didn’t hurt me. He didn’t do anything. We just talked. I think I understand him better, I think he understands us better, too.”

Yugi leaned closer to his partner, hoping his presence would help calm his partner down. Everything was okay. Yami didn’t need to be afraid anymore.

“We… He asked about the dream I had. I told him why I didn’t want to look for his memories. Why I didn’t want to get rid of the puzzle, either. He’s felt trapped, and I can understand why. I think it’s hard for him to trust us, but… He said my reasoning made sense. He thanked me, said I was thoughtful…”

Yugi looked down. Should he mention that he told Atem his name? He wasn’t sure. It was such a small part of their conversation, maybe it didn’t matter… 

“He said…the shadow games were his power, that he’s lent that power to you. He said your feelings for me were the only warmth he could find in the puzzle…”</span>

Thanked him...? Thoughtful?

Concern flashed across his features, unable to let go of his distrust yet. <em>&quot;Why did it thank you? How do you know it isn&#39;t trying to manipulate you for its own gain?&quot;</em></span>

...But if something bad was going to happen...it would have already, wouldn&#39;t it?

He closed his eyes, tried to will himself more present in the real world. He could feel Yugi...Yugi could feel him. He could see and hear him as clear as day. <em>&quot;...Y-You must...t-trust him.&quot;</em> Yami finally murmured. <em>&quot;...T-To take a chance like that.&quot;</em>

Inside the room, inside the puzzle...Atem sat in the center room. He looked at the door, which was cracked slightly now. He could see the room that represented Yugi across the hall. It was perfect, calm, full of puzzles and toys. He found out long ago he couldn&#39;t enter it. He was too...dark, for the purity of that room. But he always wanted to. He wanted to try the games in there...if there was anything he remembered, was that he liked games. 

He sighed out a breath. When he looked back down, though, he was surprised. A box...a pure white jigsaw puzzle. He turned over the box, and touched the pieces...they were real. He started to put it together. 

Yami felt...mixed. Yugi risked...them, for this spirit. One who had caused them both so much pain. And his mixed feelings had him feeling worse. Yugi was pure, and good- he had to be making the right call. Yami&#39;s feelings- they were...a poison. He was trying to turn Yugi on him for his own selfish, terrible gains. Kings and spades, his mind reminded him. He couldn&#39;t voice them. He took Yugi&#39;s hand as best as he could. <em>&quot;I- I will...trust you on this, partner.&quot;</em></span>

It felt nice. It was the first time he had ever felt it before.
