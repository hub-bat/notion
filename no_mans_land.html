How many <em>times</em> had he fawned over these prodigies, these lights in the dim of the world- now retired. Retired! And yet the call of the wild seems too irresistible. 

Four am video calls were not new. What was new was the sweater Doctor Hikari wore, the glasses lopsided on his face. This was a night he was off, for once. Not anymore. When the call connected, he sighed. 
&quot;Good...Good.&quot; He forgot if it was evening, night, morning. &quot;I trust you&#39;re both aware your Navis haven&#39;t returned yet. They&#39;re in my care.&quot;</span>

He looked to Enzan, and sighed as his hands came up. It was strange to ask this.

Doctor Hikari looked at a different monitor. All three were displayed, the slow progress bars inching by a percent every hour, it felt. 
&quot;Blues has suffered a severing of his neck and, what appear to be stab wounds in his back. Searchman...Whatever, they were against, was also dealing in fire.&quot;
He struggled to put this to words. &quot;He seemed to have been burned alive. Scorches on his armor are warped as if it were gasoline- but, it must only be a trick...&quot;

It was timely, for as soon as that was settled, Dr. Hikari dropped another bombshell.

Laika spun around, and looked back to the call screen. The look on his face spelled out what he wished to say. &#39;All three? That shouldn&#39;t be possible.&#39;</span>

He was teetering, teetering internally. As his body responded and acted his mind was somewhere else. His eyes saw grey walls and darkness.

It was something to ground them both as scary times played back in their heads. He gripped, lightly, as some of his own terrors tried to flare up.

He nodded along with Enzan&#39;s words, thanking with his free hand when necessary. It was one of those times where he wished he could speak. Enzan didn&#39;t deserve to head this conversation, not when he was struggling. Laika should&#39;ve been able to take over, and yet that wasn&#39;t possible. 

Searchman was out, his voice was gone for now.</span>

Danger failed to be sense, whether it be because there was none, or that program was simply malfunctioning. He just stared, and stared.

Why was there a drumming? The beat failed to change, lose rythmn. A human did not control it&#39;s sound. In the stillness it seemed to rock him, like a small tremor. It was impossible to ignore.</span>

Searchman went quiet again. For several minutes he just stared upwards and tried to piece things together. Everything was hazy after that shared memory he had with Laika. But he could&#39;ve sworn that beyond, something incredible had been achieved.

It was hard to think, with the beat. Blues talking over it seemed to distract him from it, but alone it was like the hum of this world. Loud, impossible to block out, overwhelming when his focus was imperative. Switching off his hearing like he usually did didn&#39;t block out the beat. 

&quot;Dr. Hikari...&quot; Searchman spoke up again, hoping that his caretaker was still there. It was so hard to stand, surely it wasn&#39;t absolutely necessary. &quot;Can- this beat be... disabled?&quot;</span>

Searchman tried to move, but froze when that caused the drumming to increase, just a little. He sat still, and waited for it to return to the rhythm it was before. It wouldn&#39;t go. The more annoyed by it he got, the fast, more obvious it became.

&quot;It- is disruptive...&quot; He added. &quot;I cannot block it- like... usual disruptions.&quot;

He did not like this change, not one bit. The more he focused on that, the louded the drummer became. Faster... slowly faster... until finally, a look of disgust came over him.

There was a desperate need for it to stop. He couldn&#39;t stand it. It was hard to try and relax when there wasn&#39;t a guarantee it wouldn&#39;t go away for good!

Blues recalled human make up. 

No, he was <em>desperately</em> happy to see Rockman, and his internal processes were matching it. 

He stood up, a small smile on his face. Searchman deserved the attention, but he had never been so pleased to see Rockman wandering around these servers.</span>

He opened his eyes to see who he picked up, and they only grew bigger from there. His reception was turned back on. He lifted his head a little, as the drumming accelerated. 

&quot;Rockman...&quot; He tried to move more, by picking up his arms or chest. Anything to keep from being looked <em>down</em> at. Soon, he stilled. 

&quot;I am glad you are okay.&quot; He stated. &quot;Was very worried.&quot;</span>

&quot;We made it,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Worried about you too, Search. Both of you two...&quot; He glanced at Blues. No, they could have their proper reunion later, he felt. Too embarrassed in front of Search...
He wanted to say sorry, but repressed the reflex. Instead, he mustered up a small, &quot;thank you.&quot;</span>

And when they touched, his chest <em>exploded</em> with the pounding, racing noise. He had to catch his breath-- was this how humans felt all the <em>time?!</em> How did they function like this? He wheezed, and it started to slow. 

&quot;N-no. Thank you, Rockman. You are the reason for our success.&quot;</span>

The recent events were becoming clearer. Searchman&#39;s focus seemed to drift as he recalled them. It was messy and jumbled, his need to defragment ran high. But that&#39;s how it was, especially the end. What Rockman was able to do while using them both.

His eyes centered, and looked back to where Blues and Rockman stood. Search wished he could stand as well, but he didn&#39;t have the strength. Plus, the drumming.

&quot;Rockman, I do- not think. Attempting what he did again is.... safe.&quot;</span>

He still <em>felt</em> them. Fragments of something still lodged somewhere within him- it wasn&#39;t necessarily unpleasant. Just something to get used to. Reds and army greens permeated his being in some way. He still felt the phantom heavy rifle on his arm, the visor in his vision. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t even know I could do that. I just acted...on instinct I guess.&quot; He smiled a little, &quot;I guess I don&#39;t know my own strength, sometimes.&quot;
A jest. His smile softened as he looked between Blues and Search. &quot;Are you two alright-? Repairs going okay?&quot;</span>

&quot;If possible- please sit.&quot; He requested. He didn&#39;t explain why, just hoped that they would understand. The stark contrast bothered him, just as much as the beat. &quot;I still- cannot move much.&quot;</span>

Searchman relaxed with the both of them now closer to the floor with him. It was shameful to admit that being as tall as he was, encountering things even taller could be a source of great anxiety. Now it wasn&#39;t an issue. He noticed that the beat slowed. 

He squirmed a little, eventually getting so that he could lift himself up enough to rest on his arms. It was barely where he wanted to be in terms of movement. The strain from just doing that seemed to frazzle his confidence. 

&quot;Rockman- are you healing- well?&quot; he asked. &quot;I am worried- because of what we face-d.&quot;</span>
