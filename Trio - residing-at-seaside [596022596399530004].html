Laika rolled his eyes over to his shoulder, giving Searchman a grumpy look. He didn&#39;t want to be up and out, but the nurses had forced him to. They needed to clean the room, or something. <s>Probably sweep it.</s> Usually it was done while he was out for therapy, but for some reason it just <em>had</em> to be done today. He was forced to go be a human for a while and it wasn&#39;t a rosy thought. 

Walking wasn&#39;t really the problem anymore, even if it did tire him still. Laika just didn&#39;t like to be seen like this. Mute, mutilated, completely messed up... what if someone recognized him? Not that they could unless they looked really close. He was still as thin as he came, and there was nothing but mint fuzz left on his head. 

&quot;<em>There is a sitting area up ahead.</em>&quot; Searchman quietly informed. 

Laika looked up from his feet and took his hand off the wall. Maybe he could read or something. A nap to pass the time, perhaps. It looked like a good place to hide away. He couldn&#39;t really see it until he came right up to it.

There were already kids there, though. Laika was probably sure they saw him too. Great.</span>

Eishi jumped at the site of a stranger. He was much smaller than Mamoru, and ducked his head a little behind his wheelchair. Upon getting a glance at Laika, he stood up from the bench, but remained behind the safety of his new friend. 

He whispered as quietly as he could to Mamoru, &quot;do you know him?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t, but it&#39;s okay.&quot; Mamoru rolls his chair out of the way from the bench. He looks up to Laika and gestures to the bench. &quot;Here you go. We&#39;ll get out of your way. Eishi, we can go back to my room...&quot; 

Eishi shook his head. &quot;I wanna say hi.&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>Thank you very much.</em>&quot; Searchman handled addressing the children further. He bowed on Laika&#39;s shoulder. &quot;<em>We apologize for the trouble.</em>&quot;

Laika busied himself with pulling out his PET. While scrolling through the most recent titles of ebooks, he wondered why the kids hadn&#39;t moved on yet. A glance up showed that the one in glasses wanted to linger. There wasn&#39;t a reason to, not that Laika could tell. He didn&#39;t look like the type to gawk.</span>

&quot;Eishi, he wants to read. It&#39;s okay if he can&#39;t talk to us.&quot; Mamoru mumbled to Eishi. 

&quot;I know it&#39;s okay. Sorry...&quot; The younger boy shrunk back and frowned. This older man was just... Interesting. Eishi hadn&#39;t reached out to many people here, but this guy seemed different. He wasn&#39;t unnerved with the worry that he&#39;d be teased or pitied.</span>

Still, compliments on Searchman&#39;s appearance still tickled whatever pride was left in him. All that hard work to make him perfect was still a very real memory.

&quot;{Thank you.}&quot; He signed back. &quot;{It took a long time. To get him like that.}&quot;</span>

Mamoru looked surprised. Eishi rarely found someone to talk to so openly- he&#39;d needed to start out talking with a normal Navi translator so Eishi could feel comfortable. 

&quot;{He looks very strong. I bet he can go on adventures.}&quot; Eishi mimicked a plane, a clumsy swordfight, and a cowboy. Mamoru got lost in the play and laughed a little. Mamoru mimed his own adventure.

Eishi calmed and twisted his shirt again, embarrassed. &quot;{What are you reading?}&quot;</span>

Searchman stopped with Laika&#39;s hand raising up. A glance was enough to keep him from sharing anymore. 

Laika just watched as the kids took a moment to play. They seemed happy, which was good. At least there were some people happy here. He could only stare. 

&quot;{Nothing exciting.}&quot; An answer came after he turned his screen off. &quot;{Sign. Learning more. This is how I have to talk now.}&quot;</span>

&quot;I don&#39;t really understand everything you two are signing,&quot; Mamoru admitted. 

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot; Eishi leaned in close to Mamoru to tell him as quietly as he could.

Laika put his hands down. This was turning into a chat, and he hadn&#39;t chatted to anyone besides Enzan in months. Worries crept up. He could scare these kids off to avoid them. The energy wasn&#39;t there. He was stuck with this. 

His affect stayed flat even as the kids talked to each other for a moment. 

&quot;<em>Do you two come to this hospital often?</em>&quot; Searchman picked up the conversation. There were enough hints to figure out what Laika wanted to know.</span>

But, to a child, maybe hospitals were different. Seeing the device was enough of a guess. That thing probably kept him from dying early. And this kid seemed so... bright.

The familiar pride bubbled up. Laika couldn&#39;t stop it from weaving through his fingers. Defend his home, his fatherland. It almost brought about a determined look in his eyes. That use to be his duty. He wished it still was.

&quot;{The new government is better. Still needs work, but better. Houses would help.}&quot;

Anything more, and the kids wouldn&#39;t care. Laika gave up on the subject, and switched back to Rockman. That was common, safe.

Eishi thought a little more, wrapped up in his imaginings of this house. 

&quot;{Basements and towers are exciting. The older kids can live at the top cause they aren&#39;t scared of heights. Then there will be lots of room for all the orphans to live together and be a family.}&quot; Eishi smiled confidently. He was missing a baby tooth. 

&quot;{Oh, and we&#39;d need a sports area. Some of my friends <em>hate</em> science, but they like sports. Maybe a baseball field.}&quot;</span>

The time Laika could think like that was so far removed from him, that he couldn&#39;t even bring up a memory. All that came back was smoke. 

&quot;{If it is in Sharo, there should be a place to play hockey. Ice skate.}&quot; he tried to offer up something to the fantasy. It was hard to think of home like this. Laika tried to think of another question. 

&quot;{Still young enough to loose teeth. No tower for you?}&quot;</span>

&quot;I&#39;m tired... I have to turn in, Eishi.&quot; Mamoru smiled wistfully. He rolled in front of Laika and bowed his head. &quot;It was nice to meet you, sir. My name&#39;s Mamoru. I&#39;ll see you around.&quot; Neither child had to ask to know that all three of them would be back many times.

Eishi reached out his hand and held it out for Mamoru to do the same. They touched hands instead of shaking and Mamoru starts to roll away.</span>

A blink, and a memory came back. Didn&#39;t Netto have a friend who went to the hospital a lot? One he always talked about being stronger than they looked. 

&quot;<em>Thank you for talking with us.</em>&quot; Searchman returned, giving a slight bow as Mamoru went. Laika raised his hand in a wave, choosing not to worry about a name. Probably for the better. Safer to keep anonymous.

But that left Eishi still. The talk of energy had him aware of just how little he had left. At this rate, a nurse would have to come get him.

&quot;{You have a good friend there.}&quot; Laika signed. &quot;{Probably makes the stays easier.}&quot;</span>

Eishi was much more subdued despite how much he communicated. He only kicked one foot out every once in a while.

Laika put his hands down for a moment. This kid was something else. A master of his own fate at very early age. And somehow still upbeat about it all. Laika tried to imagine how it was possible, he couldn&#39;t. 

&quot;{Just my mother, father, and uncle. They live far away.}&quot; He brought back. &quot;{They were here when I first came, but now they&#39;re gone. It&#39;s just myself now.}&quot;

Enzan would be left unmentioned. Who knew what else this kid was tied to. Laika wouldn&#39;t have his significant other compromised by coming here. If Enzan couldn&#39;t come visit everyday, things would be worse. Way worse. 

&quot;{The doctors like it better that way, I guess. Less pressure on them.}&quot;</span>

Everything got dark for a moment. He didn&#39;t deserve this. This was too hard. How could he stay &#39;not-dead&#39; when there was nothing of him left? His soul was already gone, up in smoke. A lump was suddenly building in his throat. This walk was supposed to prevent this. To stop him from feeling like a husk.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Eishi whispered. Was that no because Laika was going to die? Did he figure wrong? Or was this still about the loneliness?

A silent gasp of air was taken, and something warm rolled down Laika&#39;s cheek. Just one or two before he caught himself. His other hand came up to wipe the tears away, then it went to his chest. 

&quot;{Sorry.}&quot; Is all Laika signed. This kid didn&#39;t need to see anyone like this. He was overwhelmed by himself, by the thoughts. Pain was creeping back too from sitting up for too long. His back ached, and he couldn&#39;t rest it.

Eishi&#39;s offer was too good to pass up, but Laika worried that he&#39;d get there. He was tired from just the walk here and talking. It would cause a scene if he collapsed in the hallway. But staying here like this wasn&#39;t an option. What if he had a gap?

Laika nodded and stuffed the napkins away in his robe. He took Eishi&#39;s hand and used the other to help himself up. Searchman popped up on his shoulder, to help with guidance.

&quot;<em>Our room will be down that way.</em>&quot; Searchman pointed.</span>

They reached the end of the hallway, and Eishi looked to Searchman for guidance. This was taking a long time, but the kid didn&#39;t seem to mind. Eishi didn&#39;t care about Laika&#39;s scars or how slow he took walking. Some days Eishi felt how Laika looked.</span>

Searchman pointed to the left, but dropped his hand when he looked further down the final hall. There were several people coming in and out of Laika&#39;s room, with cleaning materials. One held personal affects. 

&quot;<em>I am mistaken, a right please.</em>&quot; He quickly corrected their journey. 

Laika glanced up, trying to squint and see why there was a change. He spotted someone holding his notebooks, and tried to pull away. Was he right? Were they combing his room?! He had been good! He hadn&#39;t tried to hide anything from them. Why were they taking his notes?!

&quot;<em>Sir, breathe.</em>&quot;

Laika stopped his weak resistance. He still held Eishi&#39;s hand. All Searchman did was bring attention to his physical ails. He didn&#39;t have the energy to fight. He was forced to let it happen while they walk away. It hurt. His back and neck hurt awfully.</span>

&quot;It&#39;s okay mister, I can help you.&quot; This adult man looked so <em>scared</em>. It almost made Eishi panic too, but he reminded himself that it was just how the hospital was. Everyone got scared sometimes. Everyone got tired. &quot;Is that your room?&quot; 

It was odd how all the guilty emotions and curious and uncertainty was broiling up in Eishi. It almost felt religious. He reminded himself to breath deeply, just like Searchman said. In... five counts... hold... out...

And they were back at another seating area, away from the rooms. Eishi didn&#39;t see much point in walking in circles. &quot;You should lay down sir, if you&#39;re tired. You can lay anywhere and no one will be mad with you.&quot;</span>

He touched his stomach and fiddled with the sensor there. Everything was okay, he was just fatigued like the doctors said he would be. 

&quot;It&#39;s okay if that happens though because sleeping is good for you. You&#39;re not going to miss anything big except maybe an episode of Doctor Peculiar on Marfell channel, but they play reruns all the time.&quot;</span>

His family was far away, but he already probably contacted them online if he wanted to. More friends, perhaps. People being there in person was always nice. He knew he got lonely now. His found family was nice, but nothing could replace the two people that had been God given to him being gone. 

Eishi didn&#39;t want to think about that right now. 

&quot;I can visit when I&#39;m here, sir. I think resting can be better if you have something to keep you occupied. Reading stories at rest time is what you&#39;re supposed to do. Me, or one of your friends could read you what you like.&quot; That&#39;s what his parents used to do for him, and what Eishi wanted to do for younger kids at the orphanage.

It was a promise the young boy wouldn&#39;t have to keep, however. A nurse swept over, tisking over Eishi laying on the ground again (once she was certain there was no danger.) He was gently checked up on, while another young man was called over to help Laika back to his bed. The bench was certainly no fit place for Laika to be sleeping.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Searchman did see, he had been standing by Laika&#39;s ear the entire time. But he stayed quiet, not sure if what he wanted to say would upset the boy. His operator had gone through something terrible, and help in the aftermath often came at the price of feeling overwhelmed. Laika rarely let people besides the staff and Enzan into his room. Searchman doubted that this kid would be easily remembered. 

By the time the staff came, Laika had given in to the draw of rest. He barely stirred while being lifted up and off to his room. Before they left though, Searchman bowed to Eishi. He decided to say something after all. 

&quot;<em>Thank you for spending time with us. While he did not show it, he probably enjoyed the company.</em>&quot; 

And with that, they parted, heading down the hall that was avoided before. There was a crowd around the door down there still, bit this time there was someone well dressed with white hair. They didn&#39;t look very happy.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Eishi made sleepy eye contact with the fierce looking young man. Eishi watched his expression shift into surprise for a half second, before shrugging him off and going back to being angry. Eishi liked the movement down the hall and the interesting people more than the sterile shoulder he was leaning on. There was still life all around, he felt, rather than thought. 

By the morning and into the coming weeks, the two men felt like just that, a feeling imprinted on his mind. 

He didn&#39;t bother asking Mamoru about it. He just relished in the fact that he&#39;d had a nice dream instead of a nightmare. Lately, they were hard to come by.</span>
