Summary:&#160;“Have you given up?&#160;Does it feel like a trial?”
Searchman’s exile in the UnderNet has been nothing but hell. However, just as he is about to give up, and unlikely force restores his spirits. With their help, Searchman returns to his side of the Cyberworld. But soon after arrival, he intercepts a mysterious transmission that puts the idea of Laika’s survival back into his head. Is the broadcast a red herring? Or could Searchman’s luck be finally changing for the better?&#160;
(Contains: character death, mentions of torture)&#160;
(Takes place after&#160;‘In Absentia’ and before&#160;‘The Game’)

This had always been how it was. He had always lived in the UnderNet. He had always been fighting to survive.&#160;

No. No, he had to keep reminding himself that none of that was true. He had to get back to his realm, he had to get back to Laika. Or, whatever remained of him. Searchman still foolishly hung onto the hope that Regal listened to his pleas. He hoped that his operator’s body would at least be identifiable.&#160;

Oh... <em>Laika...</em>

Searchman’s left hand carefully wrapped around his torso, covering a gash that allowed loose data to pour out of his side. He was starting to look just as bad as his operator did. His armor was cracked all over and close to falling apart. He was losing bits of data left and right. His eyes looked bleary, and the lack of his satellites presence only drew one conclusion. All three had been lost long ago.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161794805458804816 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161794805458804816><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:37 PM">6:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Despite there being no trouble at the moment, he kept himself armed with his scope gun. It rested on a rugged block of data near where he sat. looking just as beat up as he did. This spot was as far as his feet could take him, and he prayed that his surroundings would conceal him well. He dreaded going into a sleep cycle, but that’s what he needed most right now. Because if anything were to attack him now, that would be the end of it.&#160;

Though, maybe that wouldn’t be all bad. Perhaps humans and navis ended up in the same place. If that was the case, then seeing Laika there would be worth it all. It would make all this suffering justified.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161794970609520650 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161794970609520650><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:38 PM">6:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Searchman allowed his eyes to close, forcing himself to calm down enough for an attempt at rest. After this, it would either all be over, or he would’ve gained enough energy to try and get up to the next level. Regal had been cruel to throw him down this deep.&#160;

Just as the cycle was about to take hold, a light began to shine above him. Being on edge as he was, Searchman canceled the process, and snapped his eyes open. The light was blinding, enough for the discarded navi to regret looking into it. But despite it all he persisted. Whoever or whatever was emitting this light wanted him to look away. He wouldn’t allow it, even if it meant losing his sight.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161795171923537980 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161795171923537980><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:39 PM">6:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“You are a brave warrior...” A calm voice came from beyond the brightness,&#160;“To look into the face of death... deletion... and not even so much as blink.”&#160;

Searchman bidded for his right arm to move, but something denied him. It felt as if his entire body had locked up. Fear began to take hold again as he continued to stare into the light.&#160;

“Most would beg, plead for my assistance. But you... you are just lying there...” The voice seemed to be getting closer.&#160;“Is it because you are that injured? Or maybe...”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161795296221745233 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161795296221745233><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:39 PM">6:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Suddenly a figure broke through the light, and came close enough to be mere centimeters away from Searchman’s face.

He had seen this face before, but being in this bad of shape prevented him from recalling. Right now, everything was a threat. Even the things that looked close to righteousness. 

Searchman called forth his knife and broke through the freeze. Intensity grew in his eyes as it hurdled towards their torso, but it faded when he felt a hand block his path. The being’s gentle hold made his drop his weapon, and he didn’t resist as they guided his hand back to resting on the ground. Searchman continued to stare, now in pained amazement. If this was an enemy, he would’ve been deleted right from the start.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161796244998463498 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161796244998463498><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:43 PM">6:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“W... ho...” Searchman’s voice was corroded. He was barely able to speak thanks to a previous enemy taking a slash at his throat. “... a... re you...?” 

The broken question made the being’s black eyes flicker up to meet Searchman’s. For a split second, there was a look of worry, but it was quickly erased by a kind, warm smile. One hand remained on Searchman’s, but the other came up to frame their chest with its palm facing out. A holy gesture.

“I am Serenade.” Their voice gained authority. “I am the ruler of this place. I have been watching you for some time now, Searchman. It has become obvious that you do not hail from the UnderNet.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161796431879868507 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161796431879868507><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:44 PM">6:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Searchman remained mystified. Not once did this ‘ruler’ show up on his radar, even when it was still fully operational. He had no choice but to believe their words. He remembered now. Rockman and Blues had spoken of this navi before.

A wave of pain corsed through Searchman, forcing him to finally break away from his stare and wince. He took notice to the faint glow of their hand, and grew terrified. Here’s where it would end. That was an attack. He had heard of how this navi was capable of such strange and amazing powers. Searchman clamped his eyes shut, and hoped that the blow wouldn’t continue his misery.&#160;

“Do not be afraid.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161796608904659035 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161796608904659035><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:44 PM">6:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Much to his surprise, Searchman began to feel strength instead of death. Confusion riddled his processes, but he dared not to question anything. Pain ebbed from his features as Serenade’s hand passed over him. In mere seconds he was healed enough to sit upon his own without effort. The fear kept fading as his gaze returned to his savior.&#160;

Serenade now sat on the rugged blocks of data above where Searchman lounged, their hands resting at either side of them. They looked down upon him, with the same warm smile as before.&#160;

“Thank you...” Searchman breathed. He had his voice back now, but words were still failing him. “I... Thank you...”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161796867768729600 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161796867768729600><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 6:45 PM">6:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Serenade closed their eyes, and slowly nodded their head.&#160;“It is the least I can do to try and make up for all the wrongs my realm has given you.” Their smile faded. “You were not sent here willingly, were you? I sensed... foul play when healing you. I also found grief. Where is your operator?”

With that, Searchman’s gaze was cast back to the ground. After a long pause he disarmed himself, and brought his hands to his head. The memories still hurt, despite Serenade’s healing.&#160;

“He is dead.” It was so painful to recall it, but he had to.&#160;“He... he was tortured to death by an evil man. Regal he-- he set to experiment on him. I was exiled here shortly after he passed. I-- I couldn’t do <em>anything</em>-- Laika...

Why? Why wasn’t he allowed to cry? Not even for the death of his operator? His family?&#160;

Worry welled up in Serenade’s features again, but they did not hide it this time. With a wipe of their image, they were close to Searchman again. Their hands were outstretched, but hesitated to touch him. The ruler’s mouth thinned as they retracted themselves, and instead let their raiments surround the devastated navi. They bidded the cloths to carefully forced Searchman’s hands away from his head, and bring his head up once again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Searchman clenched his teeth, but allowed himself to be moved. Serenade’s words brought validation, but they also brought the heavy weight of reality. This wasn’t a simulation that he had unknowingly stepped into at some point.&#160;  Laika was really gone forever.   

The orphaned navi allowed himself to be pulled up by the raiments. His towering height dwarfed the ruler of the UnderNet, but Serenade easily fixed the issue. They called for their raiments to wrap back around them, and lifted themselves off the ground with their assistance.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161845188143087636 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161845188143087636><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 9:57 PM">9:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I will send you back to that realm.” They decreed, “This domain does not suit you, solace cannot be found here. Allow me to do this, so that you may go to him, but also to the family and friends he leaves behind. For it is with their company that you will find closure and true acceptance.”&#160;

With that, Serenade lifted one of their hands aloft, only to retract it and move back when Searchman suddenly reached out.&#160;

“W-wait--” he stammered, flinching as the ruler reeled back from him.&#160;“I-- What do I do about Regal? I have to avenge my operator! He died so that his loved ones could be safe from this man. Now... Regal might go after Enzan again-- I cannot allow that!”&#160;

Serenade stared, surprised at the sudden return of vigor. And malice.&#160;“You mustn’t allow your anger to control you.” they warned.&#160;“Aim to protect. Be their guard, not their champion. The balance between humans and navis is fragile.”&#160;

With that, they rose, extending their hand skyward. The light from before shone down on Searchman, and enveloped him within its rays. His further questions were ignored and unheard.

“Go now.” Serenade spoke, their voice fading.&#160;“I pray you find peace.”

Apparently, Searchman had been in the UnderNet for much longer than he thought. The various clocks and calendars that he passed read March, but last he checked it was still February something. His internal clock had become sluggish during his time in exile. It was quickly corrected, though it caused dread to set in.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161845617161670666 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161845617161670666><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 9:59 PM">9:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>By this point, Laika’s funeral had probably already taken place. He had probably missed his chance to see his operator again for one final time.&#160;Regardless, he headed home to Sharo to find his-- Laika’s parents. At the very least, he wanted to ensure their safety and the safety of Laika’s Uncle too.&#160;

Upon arrival, he was met with multiple tears. Laika’s mother broke down at first sight of him, but tried her best to reassure Searchman that she was relieved more than anything. But Searchman was shocked to find out that Laika was still missing. As Laika’s father explained, the vital warning that Serenade gave the navi vanished from his mind. Regal’s lab had been emptied. There were no traces of Laika. He had simply disappeared. There was nothing left of him.

The navi refused to believe it, and vowed to the parents that he’d be back as soon as he found and spoke to Enzan. He was on his way there when something strange began to crackle through his hearing receptors. The digital radio frequency he and Laika used to communicate with started to broadcast a synthesized voice.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161845826142871642 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161845826142871642><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:00 PM">10:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;I FEAR I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM, BUT I KNOW I AM IN DANGER.

BUT I AM SCARED.&quot;  

As the message repeated, a strange feeling started to well up inside of Searchman. Hope. He and Laika had never had issues with this certain frequency. It was always free of other broadcasts. To hear this message, when Laika was missing, on something that only he and Laika used... it was too much to be coincidence.&#160;

Searchman began his best efforts to locate the source of the broadcast. If any navi could do it, it was him. This was his forte! Enzan and Blues would have to wait, because now, there was the possibility that Searchman could find the thing he and everyone else was searching for.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161846020976693348 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161846020976693348><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:01 PM">10:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A lock-on, and it was close!

Searchman stumbled off of the entrance pad, and looked frantically around his surroundings. The determined smile had long since faded from view, but hope still shone in his eyes. This place was old, but definitely not barren. Searchman didn’t care about the information surrounding him. Not right now.&#160;

“LAIKA!” He called out.&#160;“Laika!! Laika, I’m here!”

His voice faded to silence, and for a while the air went stale with apprehension. His directions had been correct. There was no doubt that this was where the distress signal was coming from! But, just when Searchman thought there would be no response, there came the subtle sound of an audio channel opening.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161846954335150261 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161846954335150261><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:04 PM">10:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>“... Search?”</em> The voice was soft, as if trying to keep itself hidden. <em>“S... Searchman?”</em>

There was no doubting it. It had been too long since Searchman had heard it, but there was no doubt that voice was Laika’s! Searchman could feel his core leap around in his chest. Joy. There was so much joy within him right now. He felt as if he was about to burst.&#160;

“Yes!” Searchman exclaimed, grinning.&#160;“Yes, it’s me! Laika, oh Laika... I’ve <em>found</em> you! Are you okay? I’m going to try and contact the NetPolice! We’re going to get you to safety!”

<em>“No!”</em>&#160;The sudden change in Laika’s tone made Searchman stop. There came the sound of a few shaky breaths.&#160;<em>“No no just... please hold on...”</em>

Searchman’s joy died down a bit as he followed the command. The sound of shuffling and keystrokes could be heard, along with Laika’s labored breath. He didn’t sound healthy. As the video feed came up, Searchman understood why. Worry began to flood back in.&#160;

He didn’t want to think it, but there was nothing else to compare Laika to. He looked like death. His features were sullen, and his hair had grown out. Whatever Regal had done to him, he had only barely managed to come back from it.&#160;

“Laika...” Searchman breathed, watching his operator looked pained for a moment before reality hit. It was him, it was really him, Laika was <em>alive</em> and stable. The navi desired a copyroid so that he could go beyond this barrier and see Laika face-to-face.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161847495450697819 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161847495450697819><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:07 PM">10:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Spotting Searchman made Laika’s eyes water. He didn’t stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks as he reached forward. For Searchman, the image of his operator was obscured, but only because Laika was lightly hugging his monitor.&#160;

<em>“It’s really, really you... You’re not fake.”</em> He mumbled.&#160;<em>“You’re not fake... y-you’re not going to be deleted... I w-won’t have to watch that again.”</em>

The revelation had Searchman stagger. Copies? Did Regal still have a hold of him? There was that moment of malice again, the thing Serenade warned against.&#160;

“Laika... it is going to be alright.” Searchman’s voice was calm. He had to keep his operator calm. That was his duty.&#160;“I am here now. I am not leaving you again. We are both going to get back home. It is going to be alright... I am going to make this right...”&#160;

A quiet sniffled followed after Searchman’s words, along with the sound of Laika moving back away from the monitor. The emaciated soldier wiped away his tears, and tried his best to smile despite looking so distraught.&#160;

<em>“I... I wish you could.”</em> Laika admitted.&#160;<em>“I’m not sure how’s he’s done it, but there’s a dimensional area here. It activates whenever something comes by the island. I didn’t have room in my distress call to say that. I... I’m sorry Searchman.”</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161847741396295720 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161847741396295720><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:08 PM">10:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The news had Searchman’s shoulder’s sink.&#160;“Then... that means...”&#160;

Laika looked down to the ground, grimacing. <em>“I have to wait for someone who has the ability to crossfuse. Regal... Regal’s forced me to try and lure Enzan here.”</em>

Of course. Of course this was another trap. And surely Regal knew that Searchman wasn’t going to leave Laika now that he found him. The joy that came with finding his operator alive had been crushed by circumstance. The cycle of torture was never ending.

There was silence for a few moments, brought on by the realization that they were both still trapped in Regal’s web. Then, Laika picked his head up.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161848286555148288 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161848286555148288><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:10 PM">10:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>“But!&#160;I’ve found an interesting <strong>game</strong> to play while I bide my time here.”</em> Laika started.&#160;<em>“It’s something that came installed on the computer, and it has a two or three player option. The computer’s AI is really dated and predictable, so it’s been pretty easy to win.”</em>

Searchman tilted his head, finding the subject change curiously abrupt. It was probably for the best not to dwell on the subject of Laika’s captivity.&#160;“Do you think playing it with me would be more entertaining? I am more than willing to do that.”&#160;

Laika’s expression brightened.&#160;<em>“Aha, you read my mind! Here, let me get it set up.”</em> Suddenly the visual cut out, but the sound of a clacking keyboard still remained. <em>“It plays an awful lot like freeze tag.  Every time you get hit, you get frozen for a few seconds.   Whoever gets the most hits within the time limit wins.”</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161848587626479647 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161848587626479647><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:11 PM">10:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“It seems simple enough.” Searchman commented idly as he readied himself. The space around him started to shift as Laika initiated the game. The space was pure black, save for the details and platforms that were outlined in a cybernetic green. It looked much like a game that pre-dated Searchman’s creation. Perhaps even the creation of the modern cyberworld.&#160;

On the other side of the platforms, another player appeared. Searchman quickly took notice of them. They were some sort of bandito inspired sniper, with a radar dish serving as their hat. Their bright red rifle held a similar style to Searchman’s, only it took place of their left arm instead of the right.&#160;

<em>“Strange, isn’t it?”</em> Laika spoke through the system again. His voice sounded slightly bitter. <em>“I wonder if Regal installed this game simply because the playable character is similar to you.”</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161849116817620993 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161849116817620993><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:13 PM">10:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Ah, maybe.” Searchman’s answer was simple. He wasn’t sure what to think of the other. They seemed rather... detailed for an asset that wouldn’t usually be seen by the player. He tried not to think much of it.&#160;“I am ready to start.”&#160;

A small breathy chuckle came through Laika’s channel.&#160;<em>“Alright. Get ready.... Start!”</em>

With the buzzer, Searchman jumped away from his spot, mirror the movements of Laika’s avatar. He lept across panels and raised his scope gun, firing whenever they fell into his sights. He thought they’d be an easy target with that giant radar dish on their head, but Laika’s avatar had an unusual speed to it.&#160;

They fired back, in a very similar manner to Searchman. It was uncanny really. This was suppose to be a game but... something felt off. There were too many flags being raised here.

<em>“Ehe, have you played this before Search? You’re really good.”</em> Laika commented as he guided his avatar around.&#160;<em>“Usually by now I would’ve had 5 or so shots in.”</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161849851059912755 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161849851059912755><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:16 PM">10:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Searchman squinted, trying to keep his focus. Laika was clearly pushing the game’s limits. No wonder he had such an easy time with the packaged AI. He didn’t respond to his operator’s chatter, but instead focused on the game.&#160;

Neither one of them were getting hits on each other, it was truly a high level match up. As the game progressed, the breaths coming through Laika’s audio channel grew harder. With a minute left on the clock, he was practically panting.&#160;

“Laika? Do we need to stop?” Searchman looked up from his rifle. Concern was evident, but his answer came as a bullet whizzing past his antenna.&#160;

<em>“Keep playing.”</em>

Searchman flinched, but complied. He tried to ignore his need to check on Laika’s safety in favor of firing at the opponent. There came a feeling he hadn’t felt in long time. Not since his first DoubleSoul with Rockman. Something was obviously wrong. He felt like he was being forced.&#160;

Just as the clock ran out, Searchman’s final shot caught the edge of the avatar’s poncho. They froze until time ran out, and a classic&#160;‘WINNER’ banner hovered over Searchman’s head.&#160;

There was silence from Laika’s audio channel.&#160;

“... Laika?” Searchman dismissed his weapon, and looked to find an exit to the game. The panting had stopped. Was his operator still okay?&#160;“La--”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161850483137335367 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161850483137335367><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:19 PM">10:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>“Fire.”</em>

The avatar moved on it’s own, firing it’s rifle before Searchman got the chance to react. The bullet ripped through his torso, causing his body to lock up. His eyes widened as confusion and pain flooded his systems. The rush he still had from the game died out. His world started to slow down.&#160;

“Lai... ka...?”&#160;

<em>“Laika is dead.”</em> The voice had grown sinister in quality. <em>“Regal burned him alive. You know that. I took over the body he left behind.”</em>

“Wh--” Searchman’s voice was cut off by another bullet passing through his shoulder. He choked on his unspoken words, unable to properly react. Laika... what was Laika doing...?

A visual feed cut through the game’s layout, revealing ‘Laika’s’ face to Searchman. He was grinning manically now. The realization struck as he felt more bullets riddle his frame. This was just like the scientist’s reports. This wasn’t Laika! This was some <em>Other</em> entity!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161850613508878336 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161850613508878336><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 10:19 PM">10:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>“So... now that he’s gone, it’s time for you to leave too.”</em> They explained happily.&#160;“<em>Don’t worry, Countershade will be a wonderful replacement for you.
