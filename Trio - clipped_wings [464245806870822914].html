...

A few seconds of radio silence, and Countershade looked towards the exit of the network he was in. Usually there was a backup plan barked out by now. Why hadn&#39;t Firebird said anything yet? Unless...

&quot;<em>G&#39;dammit.</em>&quot; He launched himself away from his position, and vanished from the network. It was trouble if Firebird wasn&#39;t speaking at all, which meant he&#39;d have to go get back up.

Now, Countershade knew no one really cared for him being around, especially this fella. However, he was probably the only one who wouldn&#39;t delete him on sight. Countershade jumped through the back doors of IPC&#39;s networks, until he was face to face with Blues and his operator. He tried to look as non-threatening as possible by putting his free hand up.

&quot;<em>There&#39;s a problem.</em>&quot;</span>

He closed off communications with Enzan, and set aside his work, just for a moment. &quot;What do you need?&quot; 

Blues stood to be on the same level as him. He trusted due to Laika&#39;s status, but would never put down his guard entirely.</span>

The person he came her for was blipped away in an instant. This red fella was just a tad over protective, wasn&#39;t he? Whatever, there wasn&#39;t time. Who knows what limit he has.

&quot;<em>Cuttin&#39; straight to the chase: Firebird&#39;s trapped.</em>&quot; Countershade lifted his head, eyes peeking out from under that large disk. &quot;<em>Not in a kidnap way, either</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>They we&#39;re trackin&#39; down a pretty nasty fella, who I guess got the upper hand. Can&#39;t go to NetPolice, so I came to y&#39;all.</em>&quot; He paused and looked passed Blues. &quot;<em>Reckoned fancy pants might be the best to go make sure they&#39;s alright.</em>&quot;</span>

As if he&#39;d had over such sensitive stuff. Exact recollections were for his eyes only. The darkloid didn&#39;t say a word until they were all heading out, and he could address both of them.

&quot;<em>Few minutes ago a scaffoldin&#39; array collapsed. Firebird was caught underneath. They were tailin&#39; Wakata Yuzuru, a known dark chip ring leader, but more slippery than an eel. Firebird was lookin&#39; into a rumor that Wakata was tryin&#39; to expand beyond dark chips.</em>&quot;

The only other thing that Countershade brought up besides the map was a screenshot of a BBS post. &quot;<em>This hints at his interest in a more human market. I&#39;m wonderin&#39; if it was bait Firebird couldn&#39;t ignore.</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;I will make sure Enzan-sama is properly equipped. No more subtlety.&quot; They were pulling out the big guns. 

&quot;Excuse me a moment.&quot; Blues pulled up a screen and contacted Famous. He needed to keep the area contained to keep the enemy from escaping or harming Firebird. A dimensional area would give them the time needed to help, as long as they didn&#39;t act reckless. 

Enzan had raced to his car, and Blues took controls right away. He still listened to all the information, holding it for later processing. 

They were nearly there by the time Countershade had explained everything. It wasn&#39;t too far, until they reached the edge of the dimensional area. 

Enzan ran to the tallest building nearby, scaling the steps two at a time.</span>

As Enzan started to reach the top, Blues sped up his preparations and looked over.

&quot;Countershade, you will have to be jacked out so we can crossfuse.&quot; Blues spoke, as battle chip information flew past his visor. &quot;A computer connected to a public server, of course. I imagine you will be able to get back.&quot;

Enzan shouldered open a door, and looked for said computer.</span>

&quot;<em>Don&#39;t be lettin&#39; your operator flub, y&#39;hear? He can get miiighty touchy when the beau&#39;s involved. I&#39;d hate to have us lose this lead.</em>&quot;

With that, he was gone. Enzan had found a computer before Blues could respond. Countershade made off, jumping from network to network until he reached one inside the dimensional area. Then it was contacting Searchman again, by raising his hand up and patting the cloaked satellite that had been tailing him this whole time.

It whirred, frazzled, and unveiled itself. 

&quot;<em>Don&#39;tcha worry yer tall head. They&#39;re comin&#39;, and I ain&#39;t doin&#39; squat until told to.</em>&quot;</span>

Retrieve Laika, and search out the enemy while the dimensional area kept him trapped. Whatever small mistake Laika had made, they would correct together and take him out. Simple. 

Enzan shoved the door to the roof open, and stepped out into the chaotic sky. Wind yanked at his vest and hair. Nature already presented a challenge. He had to angle this jump perfectly to land right. 

He raced to the edge, and jumped. 

Synchro chip was solidly in his right hand. PET was in his left. Closer, closer... 3...2... &quot;slot in!&quot; He pushed the chip in, gritting his teeth as energy bent and warped around him. He flipped in the air, hair trailing behind him. Scanners moved at top speed, triangulating where Firebird could be.</span>

&quot;<em>Try to be still, please.</em>&quot; Searchman&#39;s voice crackled through the working speaker inside Firebird&#39;s helmet. &quot;<em>We made the decision to go get help.</em>&quot;

Another groan in response. They tried to talk, but all that came out was a garbled mess of electronic noises, their voice crammed in between. All they could do was wait now.

Meanwhile, the man they were chasing was shoving past panicked crowds to try and find a place to hide. He knew what this was, and whoever called for it was hot on his trail. Like that damn motorcyclist.</span>

Whoever he spotted first he would be after, and if it was the criminal, he would lead him to Firebird. 

Enzan breathed. 

He spotted a patch of unsettled debris, still floating in the glow of the dimensional area. His scanner also picked up a crowd with people running crisscross between buildings and sidewalks. He didn&#39;t have to debate long between the two clues. 

Wakata couldn&#39;t get away. He leapt over the rooftops, keeping an eye on the crowd but remaining as hidden as he could be. Everyone looked scared down there, but his visor plucked out the ones that fit the criminal&#39;s description. He manually tossed the ones that were clearly not him, and his facial recognition started to narrow it down the closer he got.

<em>There</em> Blues pointed him out, ducking under an overpass as he ran. Enzan swore. There were so many people around, and he was sure to be a fright for many.

It couldn&#39;t be helped. He activated a Fishy battle chip, and made his second leap from a building today. The virus was steered down overhead, and disappeared as soon as he could land safely.</span>

Because he doublechecked his identity, activated his rockets, and flew up into the air. He hovered for a second. A point toward the wreckage from before.

Hopefully Laika was ok. 

He&#39;d suppressed the panicked feelings a little until now, but now he was racing to his partner&#39;s side. He landed in the dust, a little away from anything fallen. His scanner worked overtime, switching to infrared.

Firebird tried not to jerk at the sound of their name being called. They would like to be pulled out of here in one piece, not skewered by poles of questionable stability. 

Still, they longed to answer back. With their helmet in the state it was, that was impossible, but there was another option. He seemed to be one thought ahead.

His head jerked toward the sound, and his scanner picked them out. Enzan cautiously surveyed where the rubble covered Firebird, and what would move if he touched.

He knelt beside where a slab of cement had struck their helmet, and lifted it away. He tossed it far from the treacherous pile, and a little close for comfort to Wakata. 

&quot;Is anything broken? Bleeding?&quot; He scanned for what might be causing the most danger. Possible moves and the outcomes calculated befor his eyes. Move that beam, and the rest falls farther down. Move that wall, and the beam plunges straight down. &quot;Don&#39;t move.&quot;</span>

Having CF Blues so close caused shame to well up inside them. Thankfully the light help their attempts to look away. 

&quot;<em>He tapped out &#39;no&#39; earlier when I asked.</em>&quot; Searchman followed up, answering the questions Firebird could not. &quot;<em>There might be some minor bleeding from scrapes and cuts.</em>&quot;

There weren&#39;t any plans to move anything other than their head. They were stuck good thanks to whatever weaselly plan Wakata managed to cook up.</span>

There was no room for mistake. 

He saw his opening, pulling a pipe out, while setting his back against the largest wall. He just had to make enough space for it. Some of the smaller rubble was tossed aside. Another set of hands would have been ideal, but that was out of the question. 

&quot;Can you lift and pull your feet out, when I give you room?&quot; There was still more in the way down at his feet, it might fall with this maneuver.</span>

Firebird turned their head back. Hearing such a pain was just something that couldn&#39;t be ignored. From the crack in their visor Laika looked out. He winced as CF Blues worked on his own. There was someone else they could call, but it was a matter of accepting such help. 

A finger tapped some more under the rubble. Rudiment messages flowed to Searchman for translation. 

&quot;<em>He says Countershade could be sent for help.</em>&quot; Searchman&#39;s voice was flat.</span>

This part couldn&#39;t wait. He had already taken too long to get here; the pressure must be painful.

His feet set on either side of Laika&#39;s head. &quot;Hold your breath, and crawl out as soon as you can.&quot; 

He pushed and pulled, and held the space so Laika had a bit more room to move. &quot;Rragh--&quot; Rocks and concrete shifted over his legs, but his torso was freed. R Blues kept their eyes down, ready to use his free leg if he could.</span>

His head rolled, knocking into CF Blues&#39; foot. A garbled strain came from the helmet as he tried again and again to no avail. Panic was starting to set it as he realized just how bad this was. 

Wakata screamed as a bright light appeared next to him. From it came Countershade, his disc blocking out the sun and putting Wakata back to silence. A grunt released as he strolled over to where CF Blues was. His rifle raised... to help push back the large slab the boy was trying to hold on his back. 

&quot;<em>You&#39;ll get trapped with &#39;em at this rate.</em>&quot; He grumbled. &quot;<em>I got this.</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;I-it&#39;s okay. Ngh-- I&#39;m going to--&quot; 

His head jerked up at the light, and his foot came down to ready position. Heartrate tripled, until Countershade began to help. 

This was okay. An extra set of hands was all he&#39;d needed. 

This way he could surge forward, and push aside all of the cement that threatened to fall from moving the largest pole. He tossed the pole aside, and immediately began clearing away the weight on his legs. 

&quot;We&#39;ve got it. Almost there.&quot; He freed his right foot of smaller debris, and lifted a large slab from his left calve. The second he was able, he scooped his arms under Laika, and hoisted him out of there.</span>

He knew the other was on their side, and that if he strayed Searchman would easily take care of it. Still, after so many years of fighting darkloids, alert was just natural. 

Though right now, the more panic, the worse off he was. Breathing was hard, especially now with dust clouding his space. The two above him working together was a sight he could barely take in, not with the tunneling his eyes started to do. The body was hyperfocused on escape, though it couldn&#39;t manage the deed itself. 

It took CF Blues finally freeing him to grab a good breath of air. Laika wheezed as he gripped loosely to his savior&#39;s shoulder. He had been through many close calls, even buried alive before. But this time he couldn&#39;t get out himself, and that frightened him.</span>

&quot;Cough.&quot; Enzan urged, but couldn&#39;t follow his own advice to <em>breath</em>.

He carried him out of the building, into the open air. The dimensional area started to fade now that they were safe. He sunk to the ground just as Blues strength left him. His back was to the wastes of the building, and Laika was still carefully held. 

&quot;Low breaths, clear it out.&quot; His eyes roamed quickly for injuries. A few open cuts that needed cleaning. Many soon-to-be bruises.</span>

Laika let go for a second to nudge the broken helmet off. It fell to the ground beside them, just as his back shook with a forced cough. It brought forth more natural ones, all in attempt to expel whatever particles he took in.

It was back to clinging as he tried to follow the advice. There wasn&#39;t any  chance he&#39;d disobey right now. He was already in enough trouble.</span>

It didn&#39;t matter who saw. All they had to do was ensure Laika was safe. 

Enzan had so many conflicting emotions he had no idea what to do with them all. He was sure they would rush in layers. Anxiety seemed like it would be the first to crack. That gun....

He should have been worrying about <em>why</em> Laika felt the need to go out personally on dangerous missions. Instead, he was still caught up in Countershade&#39;s presence.

&quot;Ugh--&quot; he finally spoke again, when he could see Laika was breathing regularly and seemed aware enough of his surroundings. &quot;What do you want me to do with the bastard that did this?&quot;</span>

There was a charge for attempted manslaughter, along with public endangerment, but those weren&#39;t the reasons why Firebird wanted him. Laika tapped his pocket a few times, coughing more. Searchman should be able to explain clearly.

&quot;<em>We saw posts about a meet up between Wakata and an interested party  regarding the use of dark aura on humans.</em>&quot; Searchman explained as he popped up with a few screens. Screenshots of the same posts Countershade shared earlier littered the air around them. &quot;<em>The digging for validity took a few days. We only realized how grave this situation was this morning, hours before the agreed upon time.</em>&quot;

&quot;H-he has it...&quot; Laika forced out a whisper. &quot;H... he&#39;s got the drug... the one that made me--&quot;

A coughing fit cut off his words. Laika buried himself into Enzan&#39;s chest as it continued.

&quot;<em>We obtained these pictures earlier. Security footage of Wakata examining bottles of serum similar to... that...</em>&quot; Searchman hesitated as he brought up the evidence. There, clearly in Wakata&#39;s hand was a clear vial with a dark, murky liquid inside. The label was readable.

                    <span class="markdown">Searchman took away his presentations soon after he saw that flash of anger. He stayed around though, standing carefully over Laika&#39;s knee. It would probably be best if these two had a mediator nearby. At least until the police arrived. 

Laika winced at the scolding, but nothing came in rebuttal. He probably <em>should</em> have gotten backup, but he always struggled with calling Enzan out of work over these things. His pride struggled too. It meant the most to him, so it wouldn&#39;t feel right if someone else took care of it.

Still... he didn&#39;t expect things to go so south, not with the information he had obtain. It was just a meeting of interest, unless...

Enzan&#39;s clinging was fought against as Laika tried to sit up. His sight blurred before focusing on Wakata who laid nearby. The rod to hold him down was overkill, but he didn&#39;t care about that. 

&quot;H... his pockets...&quot; Laika whispered. His hands rose up, finally letting go of Enzan&#39;s shirt. &quot;{Did you feel anything in them?}&quot;</span>

He walked over to Wakata with his normal gate. Casual. His foot landed on the criminal&#39;s hand. He didn&#39;t care how much pressure he put down, but he bent over and slipped his hands into pockets and patted down anywhere else he might be hiding things.</span>

Laika pulled his busted helmet over, examining it. It was costly to buy... hopefully he could fix it on his own. A shrill voice forced his head up, and gaze towards where Enzan had walked. 

&quot;Get your paws off of me-- OOOW owowow!!!&quot; Wakata continued to shriek as he was searched. He  wriggled around his hold, trying to keep Enzan&#39;s hands from searching too deep. 

But a discovery was inevitable. Lining the inside of his shirt, Wakata had a small vial tucked away. Pulling it out would reveal the same one seen on the security still. And along with it, a syringe, carefully tucked away and unable to do harm unless set up.</span>

There was a tug at the back of his head. He held the vile above Wakata. The world started to fall away, and his blood roared in his ears. His foot <em>pressed</em> down and he heard a snap. It shook him from the moment. 

The evidence was pocketed, and he wobbled as he looked over to Laika. He didn&#39;t even want to bring this trash close to him. 

&quot;It was here. I&#39;ve got it.&quot; He wanted to <em>crush</em> it.</span>

Laika had taken his riding jacket off in the meantime, trying to detach himself from whatever Enzan did. It was easy to hide evidence of his being the firebird by simply turning the jacket inside out. As it  was slipped back on, Enzan was heading over.

His hands hesitated, both over the news and the malice Enzan carried now. They both needed to get out of here, but not while carrying evidence.

&quot;{I&#39;m sorry.}&quot; Laika signed because he didn&#39;t know what else to do.</span>

When they reached the car, Laika leaned against it and signed. &quot;{Take the evidence we compiled, it&#39;ll help indict him. As for the attempt to harm me... I trust you can work something out.}&quot;

He didn&#39;t want to risk revealing himself to the NetPolice too early. Enzan was smart and held power. He&#39;d easily convince them to believe whatever he said.</span>

He flashed the small usual sign in response before getting into the car and tending to himself. It would be easier this way, less stress on them both. Though, as Laika looked out to watch Enzan head back, he had to wonder just what exactly was going through his head. 

Wakata had settled down, shifting into whimpering and shedding tears over his broken finger. When he spotted Enzan walking over, though, he immediately started to get worked up again. Heels helplessly scuffed against the pavement to try and move, though just like before, his bind was too good.

He reached out to accent the question. He threatened to grab his hand, but reached for his collar instead. &quot;Just tell me, and this will go easier than you deserve.&quot;

The addictive pull was ringing in his ears. Calling him closer, so he could maime without inhibition. Kill this man, it said. That&#39;s better than he deserves. 

Enzan exhaled, and clutched Wakata&#39;s shirt tighter. He curled his fist.</span>

The police were starting to pull up, and Enzan paced until they started to swarm the area. 

He explained everything in truth to the main officer, only omitting Laika&#39;s identity from the equation. They muttered about how overkill his solution had been. Was he losing his touch? Ijuuin Enzan had never needed a crutch for a common criminal. He dismissed their mumblings with a glare, and finished his report. 

Heat at the back of his head was still distracting him when he turned to walk away. It was the roaring that reminded him he still had the evidence. 

He pulled it out of his pocket. The feeling grew louder, urges pushing him forward. He swallowed, shook his head, and jogged back over to the officer. 

&quot;I&#39;ll pay his medical bills too. Keep this in high security. I want to know where it came from.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Wakata was relieved to have the police appear. Even if it meant possible jailtime, he would at least be away from such a scary person. He tried to catch his breath as the police circled around him. The bar that was bent over him wouldn&#39;t be easy to remove. 

The others who talked with Enzan collectively nodded their heads, and took away the evidence with a promise that it would be regarded as dangerous. They all went to their own work, some pulling out tools to dismantle Wakata&#39;s prison. 

Meanwhile, Laika watched form the car. He had ran out of supplies to patch up everything, but the major cuts were taken care of. It was unsettling to look at the bandages that littered his arms and legs, so he made do with whatever he could catch outside. Enzan had been forceful, appropriately so in his eyes.</span>

&quot;Mm...&quot; he closed his eyes, curling his fingers and taking stock of how he felt. When he finally could breath without the weight of temptation and terror on his chest, he opened them again to look at Laika. 

&quot;That was... messy. Please don&#39;t do anything like that again without me. I know you are more than capable. But when it comes to this...&quot;</span>

He hated admitting that truth.  Laika let his hands be still as the car took a turn. His head was bowed as he looked towards Enzan. That display from before was all for him, and he appreciated it. Yet, he probably deserved a little bit of that rage as well. 

Suddenly his shoulders tensed up. His brow knitted together as his hands lifted back up. 

&quot;{I want it to end. I thought it was over...}&quot;</span>

HeadQuarters has really good people on the case. This new information... they&#39;ll send Penelope and Netto and plenty of older, <em>more</em> experianced agents to get this settled.&quot; 

He leaned forward in his seat, and reached out to touch Laika&#39;s knee. This wasn&#39;t the answer, and they both knew it, but it had to be said.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to do this. I know you feel like you&#39;re atoning for something, but this <em>part</em> of it you can distance yourself from. Or at least... don&#39;t go in alone.&quot;</span>

Yes, this atonement, but it was also protection. No one else knew what that drug could do to them. Treating it like some recreational thing would be playing into it&#39;s hands! 

Enzan gave him an out at least. Laika took in a gasp of air, and successfully kept his tears at bay. He moved his hand forward and rested it on top of Enzan&#39;s for the moment. Then it lifted. 

&quot;{I need to make sure it doesn&#39;t do what it did to me to anyone else. As long as the others have that same goal...}&quot;</span>

&quot;It&#39;s hard for us after everything, but we need to trust our colleagues. God I know that&#39;s hard for me.&quot; 

His arm pulled up to wrap around Laika&#39;s waist. &quot;You know you can count on me. Even if you want to keep the circle small... you can still do it.&quot;</span>

He was suddenly so tired. Enzan probably was too. 

Lips moved to try and mumble something, but his voice wasn&#39;t allowed to come out. A flinch in his expression was the only response. Instead, he showed Enzan a familiar sign. One given many times over the course of a usual day.</span>

He would do a better first aid, help him clean up from all the dust... and help him relax. 

They both needed to just be each other&#39;s partner right now. Nothing more.</span>
