He would not allow this to break them apart, to force him on this crusade of looking for these memories. They were not his! He did not want them, he never wanted them, he only wanted memories with Yugi!

The shadow suddenly had a smile, yellow and glowing like the rest of his features. <em>You love that boy so much.</em>

&quot;Shut up,&quot; He growled. 

<em>Your bond would solve this, wouldn&#39;t it. Then why don&#39;t we tip the scales in your favor?</em>

<em>If you&#39;re so confident.</em>

Inside of the world of mazes appeared Yugi, tossed near Yami. Yami grit his teeth, and ran for him. &quot;Yugi- I&#39;m sorry, I-&quot;

<em>Save your apologies.</em> The form smiled. <em>It&#39;s game time.</em></span>

When it waved its hand, They were all suddenly seated at opposite ends of a large table. Cards were scattered amongst the tabletop. <em>This is familiar, hm?</em>

And it looked at Yugi. <em>I grow tired of your wants. I want my memories. Beat me in this game, and I will leave you be. But if I win, you will relent.</em> 

Yami grit his teeth. &quot;We can beat this, partner. We have before.&quot; He looked over at him. &quot;You recall. We trained for this.&quot;

He’d beaten Yami in shadow games before. He could beat this darkness, too. He was sure of it. This was what they trained for.

He looked towards the form. “I promise you, if you win, we’ll do what you want, but we’re going to win. We can defeat you together.”

His turn first, then. He needed to trust himself. He flipped over two cards. A match. Yugi sighed with relief.</span>

A wave of the hand. Two cards flipped themselves over without it touching them. Two aces. They both were of the hearts suite. So were the matches Yugi made. 

<em>I will choose...</em> It smiled. <em>Yugi.</em> 

Yami grit his teeth. He wasn&#39;t even allowing him a chance, unless Yugi missed his next draw. Which would hurt him more. He had to remain strong. He couldn&#39;t just let this thing get to him- he had to be strong, for Yugi.</span>

Yugi screamed as he was shocked. His pain tolerance still needed work. Once the shock relented, he hunched over, leaning against the table. He gasped for breath. 

He reached out for two cards without a word. Pain, however, clouded his mind. He flipped over a six and a two.

Not a match.

He was shocked again. Yugi screamed louder this time.</span>

He directed his anger at the shadow. He didn&#39;t look away from its eyes as he chose a card. Two queens. &quot;You,&quot; he growled. 

The shadow shivered again, its own pain tolerance much, much higher. When it untensed, it kept its eyes trained on Yami, too. Waved its hand, and two cards flipped. Two kings. 

<em>Yugi,</em> It smiled, as a shock ran up Yugi again. Yami couldn&#39;t help his outburst- &quot;You sick, evil spirit-! What king does this to someone who he wants something from?!&quot;

<em>One who is not afraid to do what is necessary, to take what is his. Your move, Yugi.</em></span>

Yami really was his better half. Better than him in every way. Better than him in dueling, in these shadow games… Even when they’d been separated during that Dungeon Dice Monsters game, Yugi hadn’t been able to win without help.  Was Yugi really worth anything on his own?

No, he was more than just a shadow. It was about time he proved that. It was time he proved who the real shadow was.

Yugi sat up straight, seemingly getting a second wind. He looked different now, though. Red mixed in with the purple of his eyes. A third eye glowed red on his forehead. Any sign of tears or pain was gone.

He flipped over two cards. Two threes. He looked towards Yami with a malicious smile. 

“Do you think you’re too good to play? Come on, <em>my king</em>, join the game.”</span>

Yugi did that to him.

Yugi...<em>chose</em> to do that to him. 

Yami reached and flipped over two cards. Two...Jokers.

<em>A miss.</em> And the shock ran through him again. His eyes fell to the table, his breaths coming out in short pants. He didn&#39;t speak. 

The shadow turned over two cards. Their own first miss. The shock almost made it laugh this time. <em>Your move again, Yugi.</em></span>

&quot;Yugi,&quot; He rasped. He looked at him- <em>really</em> looked, his eyes growing darker. A tear slipped down his cheek, but his expression had hardened. Yugi&#39;s face to him was mixed together, his vision blurring. &quot;Is this what you truly want? Do you want to play this game, against me?&quot;

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yami didn&#39;t react- barely <em>breathed</em> as Yugi kept talking. And those words to come out of his beloved&#39;s mouth were like the greatest poison of all. Is this what had it always been, then? Was his fight against fate a useless crusade, a tiring battle- and for what gain? He was better off without him. Yami never belonged in this world, he never was <em>meant to be here.</em> That puzzle was never meant to be solved, he was never meant to be <em>human.</em>

His fingertips twitched again.

And all this had proven it. His force was a curse as everyone had said. Despite his best efforts to be pure, the darkness followed him and was taking Yugi, too. And such a pure soul to be marred by his inky black, his terrible soul. 

He took a breath in. Out. 

Yugi had friends and a family that loved him in ways that Yami thought were different than his. He thought what he offered was something sacred, holy, a part of love so deeply connected to Yugi it could never shatter. But maybe it was never love, maybe it was sick obsession, maybe Yami had just been desperate to use the boy he was suddenly latched onto. And those people never hurt him. Those people never cut his wrists or made his body wretch in emotional pain not his, never forced him into terrible games, never sent him down a path of danger. 

He wasn&#39;t meant to be here. He wasn&#39;t meant to love Yugi.

&quot;...Then, I suppose...&quot;

His hand lowered, he picked up a pair of cards. &quot;Our memories must end here.&quot; When he flipped them, they were a match. Two aces. One of them, however, was a spade, and the other a heart.</span>

As soon as the words left his lips, Yami dropped the cards. The pain had grown worse, suddenly. He didn&#39;t waste time, though. &quot;Because I-I have- b-been chosen, I can- g-go again.&quot;

He flipped another pair. Two eights. A spade and heart. &quot;Myself,&quot; he rasped. Again. Two sevens. Hearts and spades. &quot;Myself,&quot; he wheezed. Again, <em>&quot;myself,&quot;</em> again. He cleared another four pairs before he finally couldn&#39;t reach what he wanted to choose again. His mouth was full of blood from biting down on his own tongue. The mismatched pair: a king of spades, and jack of hearts. 

The shadow, however, had not stopped smiling. <em>Your move again, Yugi.</em>

There were four cards left on the board. Yugi would know exactly which was which, due to Yami&#39;s final mistake. He was leaning against the table, blood dribbling from his lips. His eyes turned to Yugi when the shadow said his name. 

&quot;Even if this is where our memories end,&quot; he whispered, through blood and pain in his mouth, but even worse in his heart- &quot;I will never forget your smile, partner.&quot;

And his voice was warm and sweet, like a rumble through his chest, a lovely thing.</span>

They had technically, won. Yami flipped the last pair. The shadow waited, expectantly. Yami had to call the shadow as his choice to win the game.

<em>&quot;Myself,&quot;</em> he rasped. No pain came. The game was over. But he found himself repeating the word, flipping over cards in his own mind. Where was the king&#39;s pair? Why couldn&#39;t he find it? He had just <em>seen</em> it. But now the memory felt hard to access. Yami had lost by his own admittance. He had thrown, just so that he would not have to harm Yugi. He could have easily directed his efforts against the shadow, but it didn&#39;t matter as soon as their memories had come into play. All that mattered then was his...

The shadow had stood, approached Yugi.

Yami lifted his head, looked at his hands. What- what had he just been doing? Why was he in so much pain? He felt so heavy. He looked at the shadow and Yugi. 

He didn&#39;t recognize either of them.

<em>For the loser, a penalty game.</em> The shadow had put his hand on Yugi&#39;s cheek, had tipped his head just so. <em>To forget, and be forgotten. Worthless memories don&#39;t have a place with us. Isn&#39;t that right, prince?</em></span>

He leaned into the shadow’s touch. His third eye glowed impossibly bright.

“What memories?” He looked up at the shadow with an expression full of adoration and love. “The only memories that matter to me are yours, my king. The only thing that matters is finding them.”

He would do anything for that goal. Anything his king required of him. He was his king’s prince, his king’s servant.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yami opened his eyes. 

A nightmare. 

Just a nightmare. There had been no penalty game, there had been no fight inside his heart. It was a school night. Yugi had a test in the morning. He had been studying for it just hours ago, and Yami had been helping him here and there. Encouraging him, giving him affection for correct answers. It had been good. 

So why did the darkness creep in again?

It was a school night, he reminded himself. He tried to give the body back up, but found himself cemented in it. He couldn&#39;t bother Yugi, he tried his best to keep the fact he was awake away from Yugi. He couldn&#39;t be the reason he failed another test. 

Another. The thought came crashing in waves. Yami really was hurting Yugi&#39;s life. All he offered was meaningless distractions to break up how often his existence put him in danger. And even those were bothering him. He turned over, pressing his eyes into the sleeve of his- <em>Yugi&#39;s</em> pajamas. He kept his tears wordless and the shakes in his body minimal. He tried to will himself from the body. Tried to force himself to retreat. But he stayed. 

Maybe this was his damned penalty. Being forced to stay here and risk waking Yugi up. His rage made him reach up, grab his hair, tightly. He wanted to tear it out, and had to remind himself that it wasn&#39;t his body. He was an intruder inside of it. Visions of himself being harmed played behind his squeezed shut eyes, uncontrollably. He knew waking up Yugi was inevitable, but now that the snowball had started to roll he was powerless to stop the oncoming avalanche.</span>

Why was his partner upset?

He grabbed his partner by the shoulder, tried to shake it gently even though he knew he couldn’t. But he had to do something, he had to try. 

How many nightmares had his partner calmed him down from, after all?

“Partner, what’s wrong? I’m here, talk to me, please…”</span>

Why couldn&#39;t he leave the body? Why did he have to be <em>stuck</em> in it, why did he have to hold it hostage away from Yugi, away from its rightful owner?

He couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. He turned over and pushed off the bed, moving through the vision of Yugi. He went over to the desk, and in the bottom drawer he produced a deck of playing cards. He shuffled them, and dealt out a grid of cards. Maybe, maybe if he could- if he could win this, it would make this damn headache stop. It would let him leave the body, let him end this terrible penalty game. 

He flipped a pair. To him, he saw a mismatched pair of kings. One of hearts, one of spades. He tried another. One of hearts, one of spades. His hands shook. They needed to be the same suite. They needed to be just <em>right</em> or he&#39;d never atone-

To Yugi, though, none of the cards would match, not value or suite.</span>

…What was he doing?

A jack of clubs, an ace of diamonds. A three of spades, a nine of diamonds. Was he trying to match them? None of the cards were even close to matching.

“Partner.” He tried to grab one of Yami’s shaking hands. “Talk to me. Look at me. Something. Please. I’m here, I’m not going anywhere, please, tell me…”</span>

The last one was a true match, though. The king and jack of hearts. But to Yami it was all wrong, nothing matched and he was never getting out of here.

He grabbed the rest of the deck, and started searching through it. All it was to him was hearts and spades, the kings of each staring back at him, reminding him of what he had done, what we was <em>bound</em> to do-

He threw the deck on the desk. Finally, he looked up at Yugi. He had the urge to throw himself at his partner&#39;s feet, to beg on his knees for forgiveness for all the things he had done and would ever do. His eyes, red-ringed and exhausted spoke these volumes to Yugi. &quot;I&#39;m s-orry.&quot; he finally mumbled. And his words were raspy, like he had been using his voice all night. &quot;I-&#39;m s-orry I&#39;m h-ere.&quot;</span>

He jumped as the deck hit his desk, but didn’t lose his composure. He moved closer to Yami, reached up to cup his cheek.

“I’m glad you’re here. I want you here, by my side. Every word of it was true. He spoke quietly, gently. “There’s nothing to forgive. You’ve done nothing wrong.”

His partner did so much good for him. Yami helped him study even though he didn’t understand the material, he protected Yugi from harm and kept him safe, he helped Yugi and made him happier than anyone else in the world. What was there to forgive?</span>

His hands shook too much to hold any for long, and they were all still the same to him. He finally let out a strained wail. 

&quot;I want t-o make it r-right.&quot; He whispered, like he couldn&#39;t force his voice any louder. &quot;It won&#39;t- the cards, they&#39;re all- the deck-&quot;

He started hyperventilating. His chest shuddered with each breath, and his words skipped like he was a broken record. It hurt. He&#39;d never been like this before, never been so haunted like this before. He reached for the cards again. 

This time, he dropped them like they had burned his hand. They were no longer playing cards. It was doubles of <em>his</em> card. The shiny Kuriboh card, Yugi&#39;s first gift to him. And they were all looking at him, mocking him, all those eyes seeing how <em>pathetic</em> he is. 

He wanted to throw himself against Yugi, pray for his forgiveness like he was his own personal deity. But he couldn&#39;t. He was stuck in the body, and he was using it like a puppet and-

Yami only then realized he had started to babble out apologies with each breath, out of his control. Each breath was an apology, his chest jumping with each one. Why couldn&#39;t he just <em>stop fucking fronting?!</em> His rage blinded him again, and he ended up smacking the side of his head. He just wanted it to be over.</span>

Yugi couldn’t do it. He couldn’t help Yami like this. He took a step forward, grabbed one of Yami’s hands, and pulled him into their inner world.

It looked the same as usual: like their room, but with some differences and oddities here and there. But here, he could actually touch his partner properly, at the very least stop Yami from hurting the body they shared.

He leaned forward, and pressed a light kiss to Yami’s cheek. He leaned his forehead against Yami’s.

“My love, please, look at me. Listen to me. I’m not going to hurt you. Everything is okay.”</span>

&quot;Partner,&quot; he mumbled, his hand taking Yugi&#39;s. He gripped it tightly, like he would float away otherwise. Yami&#39;s expression twisted. &quot;I-I-&quot;

He felt dizzy. He swayed, feeling himself slump against Yugi. His eyes were heavy, and he tried to keep them open. &quot;I n...n- n...I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he forced himself out. &quot;N-Night...nightmare.&quot; 

That&#39;s what it was. A nightmare. Not reality. This was real. &quot;M-My eyes...I- I couldn&#39;t...&quot; He looked up at Yugi. It was very, <em>very</em> uncharacteristic of him. Even worse than his first nightmare. He still looked hypervigilant, but his body was heavy. &quot;A-Are...you alright?&quot;

He reached up, and moved to touch the back of Yugi&#39;s neck. He was checking for any burns that would have happened during that game. Even now, he had to make sure his partner was okay. It was the least he could do.</span>

He rocked them back and forth a bit, swaying just enough to hopefully be soothing.

“I’m okay. I’m not hurt, I promise.”

As he comforted Yami, he could feel his own thoughts racing. A nightmare, and Yami had flinched away like Yugi would hurt him… Had the nightmare been about Yugi? Did he hurt Yami in that nightmare?

He felt ashamed that Yami would dream  of something like that… He must not be a very good partner, to allow this kind of dream to happen.

“I’m not going to hurt you, I promise.” He kissed Yami’s forehead lightly. He couldn’t let these worries overwhelm him. His partner needed him.</span>

He looked frantic, still, his mind clearly not completely grounded. 

&quot;And I am <em>poisoning</em> you.&quot; He turned his head, this way and that. Like he was trying to find where his darkness had started to take hold of him. Was it in the crook of his neck where Yami pressed kisses over math equations? Was it in his hair, that he had spoken of brushing out for him when he had worried it into tangles? &quot;All I have done is bring you- bring you danger, in return for- for what?&quot; 

He didn&#39;t make any sense. He shook his head. Why wouldn&#39;t his words match up with what he was trying to say? &quot;In return, I hurt you, and instead of solving the problem- instead of-&quot; He started to breathe heavily again, shaking, his hands dropping. &quot;I-Instead of leaving you in peace, I am tethering myself to you. I am making you <em>take care of me.</em> As if- as if a <em>curse</em> like me should be nursed,&quot; He lifted his hand and tugged at his own hair again. Again. 

The words came back. <em>Are you really what&#39;s best for me?</em>

&quot;I-I could not be the best for you,&quot; He looked at the false moon out of their window. He couldn&#39;t look at Yugi. He didn&#39;t <em>deserve</em> to look at him. <em>I didn&#39;t get hurt like this before I met you.</em> &quot;Y-You were safe, before I was here.&quot; <em>I don&#39;t need you.</em>

<em>I don&#39;t need you.</em>

<em>Those memories mean nothing to me.</em> It was so loud again, he was afraid Yugi would be able to hear his thoughts. These terrible things. He put his hands over his ears, and shook, becoming quiet again, lost in the cacophony inside of himself.</span>

He cupped Yami’s face between his hands, and gently turned his head to face him. “Look at me, my love. You are not a curse. You’re not poisoning me. Look at me. I’m okay. Do I look hurt to you?”

He brushed his thumbs along Yami’s cheeks. “I am <em>so much happier</em> now than I was before you came into my life. I didn’t have the friends I have now. I didn’t have a partner who loved me and protected me from harm. You’re not a curse, you’re a <em>blessing</em>.  If I lost you…”

What would he do, if he lost his partner? Yugi wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure he could go on without him.

He leaned forward and kissed Yami’s lips.</span>

What took over, then, was waves of sorrow. His wail was caught between their lips, as he threw his arms around him. He didn&#39;t want to be away from him, he didn&#39;t want to hurt him, and maybe it was so <em>selfish</em> of him but he couldn&#39;t help it. Yugi made his heart sing, made him feel light, made him feel whole. 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to forget,&quot; He prayed between their kisses, which he only parted long enough to breathe and babble, &quot;I <em>never</em> want to forget, please, <em>please,</em> don&#39;t forget me-&quot;

And it was selfish, and he felt so very terrible for it. But the vision of him looking at Yugi, not knowing who he was, and Yugi not caring for him was sore and loud. Memories were such a terrible, awful thing for them right now. 

But it was all he could cling to. He felt terrible, tears staining both of their cheeks now when he finally parted. He couldn&#39;t stop crying, he swore his tears were threatening to flood the room. He looked miserable. This dream had been the worst of all. It had felt so real.</span>

When they parted, he pressed his forehead against Yami’s again. He wrapped his arms around Yami’s neck.

“I’ll never forget you. <em>Nothing</em> could ever make me forget you. And I won’t let you forget, either. We’ll both remember, and we’ll stay together forever.”</span>

He dropped his head to lean on his shoulder. &quot;I dreamt we played concentration with the puzzle.&quot; He mumbled. &quot;And...&quot;

He didn&#39;t want to admit it. Didn&#39;t want to admit that he had watched Yugi hurt him. Twisted his perfect face into such an evil expression. &quot;The puzzle told you, you were trapped in my shadow. And you became...You became angry with me. You chose me for punishment.&quot;

He curled his hand to bunch up Yugi&#39;s pajamas in his hands. He felt terrible. But if he didn&#39;t get it out, he feared it would eat him alive. &quot;When a player was punished, it was then their move. And...I could- I could not bear you to be harmed. I could not bear you to be hurt, even if you did not want me anymore. So I chose myself for the punishment. I wanted to end the game, I wanted...&quot;

What did he want? If he had won, what was the outcome? What had he been chasing, shock after shock? Maybe- maybe it was to shock himself to death, so that he wouldn&#39;t have to face Yugi. Maybe it was to protect him from the shadow. He didn&#39;t know. 

&quot;I lost.&quot; He bit the inside of his cheek. &quot;And...you went- you allied with the...You-&quot;

His breaths caught again. The image of Yugi looking at the shadow with such love and adoration was burned into his mind. &quot;Y-You t-told me our m-memories d-did not matter.&quot;</span>

He would <em>never</em> betray Yami, never do something to hurt him that way. Allying himself with the puzzle was out of the question. He couldn’t let Yami think he would do such a thing for a single second longer. Where had he gone wrong, to allow such a nightmare?

“I’m not trapped in your shadow. We’re stronger together, we’re equals. I don’t believe I’m trapped by you, I’ll <em>never</em> believe that.”

He pressed a kiss to Yami’s head. “I don’t want to help the puzzle. I’m not interested in searching for those memories. I’ll fight against it as many times as it takes. <em>You’re</em> the one I want, partner. You’ll always be the one I want.”

All his love and adoration in the waking world was for Yami. No one else. No matter how vulnerable he was, pulled into a storm by his own nightmares. He loved him through not just the good, but the bad as well. 

“Our memories… They mean <em>everything</em> to me, Yami.”</span>

His face was a myriad of emotions- embarrassment, fear, and exhaustion at the forefront. It would take some time for the nightmare to fade, for his fears to subside. He knew Yugi was being truthful, he knew he was right and everything was well...

He took both of Yugi&#39;s hands, kissing each knuckle. He took his time with it, the action almost like a ritual. He looked back up. &quot;You are the strongest person I know. You must not forget this. Whether I am behind you, or not. You are so very strong.&quot;

Their memories...He couldn&#39;t tell Yugi that in the nightmare, he had forgotten him. He could not. He feared it would make his partner feel as though Yami could easily let him go. He pressed Yugi&#39;s hand to his own cheek. 

&quot;...You have a test tomorrow,&quot; he mumbled, and his voice was sad. &quot;I do not want to make you fail another test.&quot;</span>

He knew from experience the nightmare wouldn’t fade immediately. He still caught himself worrying and fearing over the nightmare he had playing the shadow game against Yami, from time to time. But hopefully his words helped. He was willing to assure his partner as much as he needed, to help heal the wounds his dream self had inflicted.

“I’ve studied for the test plenty. I’ll be fine.” He smiled. “You’re much more important than that test, anyway. I’m not going anywhere.”</span>

He rubbed his eyes again. &quot;I am so tired. May we lay down.&quot; His head ached, but he wasn&#39;t sure he could sleep again. He was so afraid he would close his eyes, and Yugi would look back at him with red eyes and hate in his heart for him.</span>

Not stand next to him while he was trying to take his math test, tapping his foot and looking constantly between him and the door and the other students. Why couldn&#39;t he hide like he usually did in school? He kept looking at Yugi, expecting something to be different.

Yugi needed to concentrate on his math test. All his studying would be paying off if he could, he remembered most of this material. But <em>someone</em> standing next to him was being very distracting.

He didn’t look up at Yami, didn’t respond to his apology. He didn’t want to get in trouble for “trying to cheat”. But maybe, also, if he didn’t acknowledge his partner in the room, he would go away.

…That would be too convenient. He was going to have to learn how to take this test with his partner at his side, and fast.</span>

<em>Just like in your dreams,</em> he heard, <em>how you forgot him and he forgot you. It&#39;d be easier that way, wouldn&#39;t it? He&#39;d be a lot happier and safer if he didn&#39;t have to worry about you.</em>

Yami couldn&#39;t control his outburst- <em>&quot;BE QUIET!&quot;</em>

Shoot. 

He covered his mouth. Suddenly his form did disappear. Right into the puzzle. He found himself throwing open doors, trying to find the answer to making himself better for Yugi. But all he found were traps. 

At least Yugi could take his test now.</span>

He felt sick. No, he couldn’t focus on this. He had a test to take. After class, after class, after class…

He repeated it in his mind like a prayer. He hated that he had this stupid test to take. It was even harder to concentrate now than before. Bur he picked up his pencil and forced himself to work.</span>

Lunch time. Test was over, and class was a blur. Yami was stuck out during school again, his head slumped against the table next to Yugi. He was killing his appetite. His thoughts were still an angry cloud. He felt so damn useless, so terrible. He prayed that once he left, Yugi could focus on that test earlier. He hoped. 

&quot;Hey, Yuge, you haven&#39;t touched your lunch. What&#39;s up?&quot; Yami glanced up at Joey. He mumbled an apology to Yugi.</span>

He poked his food with his fork, otherwise not really touching it. Eating was important, he knew that! He just…couldn’t. Between Yami’s usual bad appetite and Yugi feeling sick himself, it just wasn’t happening.

He looked over at his partner before looking up at Joey. “Um, my partner had a nightmare last night… guess it’s affecting both of us right now.” He sighed. “I feel sick.”

<em>”What’s the matter,</em> king<em>? Isn’t this what you wanted? He remembers you again, loves you again.”</em>

No one else would see, not even Yugi, but Yami would be able to see someone in the seat across from him. His eyes were red, his third eye glowing a bright red to match. His voice was completely absent of concern, filled instead with malice and contempt.</span>

A deck of cards appeared in his hands, and he shuffled them, trying to get out his fears. He didn&#39;t look, didn&#39;t respond. Yugi would be able to see, though, that the deck was wrong. Every card was the king of hearts and spades. And his shuffles were wrong, too. He riffle shuffled the deck, which he never did- he didn&#39;t like how it strained and bent the cards.

&quot;Awh- jeez.&quot; Joey frowned. &quot;Ya need to talk about it? Y&#39;know I&#39;m always here to listen.&quot;

To Yami, Joey&#39;s voice was so far away. He couldn&#39;t even hear it anymore.</span>

 Yugi paused. He could see the king of spades and of hearts in the deck, and then he saw them again; where were the other cards? The cards looked like they were in pain. Yami looked like he was in pain.

“He dreamed about me betraying him, hurting him. And, apparently, he dreamed about us forgetting about each other, too. I could never forget him! But if he ever forgets about me…” Yugi wasn’t sure what he’d do.

The vision of Yugi across the table grinned. <em>”Aww, even your dreams are hurting him. Poor thing.”</em></span>

Yami wished he could hear what Joey was saying, over the roar of his own heartbeat in his ears. He finally forced himself to look up at the vision he was having. It took everything in him to not wince. 

<em>&quot;Leave me be,&quot;</em> He whispered. <em>&quot;Y-You aren&#39;t real.&quot;</em>

Yes he was, Yami&#39;s thoughts betrayed him. Yes, this is what he would turn Yugi into, this is what he would poison him with. He felt sick, like if he were in the body he would wretch. He started thumbing through the cards. Hearts and spades. The kings were laughing at him again. He took a breath in. He was just seeing things, right? Just like last night. If he just, breathed, it would pass. 

It wasn&#39;t passing. Red eyes still looked back at him. He wondered if he was haunted now, this was his punishment. He felt dizzy.</span>

&quot;And he loves you a lot.&quot; Yami could suddenly hear Joey. He looked over at him. &quot;If I know that guy, he&#39;d do anythin&#39; for ya.&quot;

And there was his heartbeat in his ears again, drowning out the rest of Joey&#39;s words. Anything for Yugi. That was right. Yami loved Yugi more- more than anything. More than he cared for himself. He would do anything for Yugi. 

He looked back at the person sitting across from him. 

<em>&quot;I want to save you,&quot;</em> he whispered. He held his breath. Why did he feel so dizzy, why was the back of his mind screaming at him? <em>&quot;I will atone. What game shall we play...prince.&quot;</em></span>

Yami felt the world close in on the two of them. He couldn&#39;t see or hear anything else, just this terrible card game, and the vision of his partner. He took a deep, shaking breath. Would it hurt like last time? He felt his body instinctually recoil at the idea. But he pressed forward. 

<em>&quot;No,&quot;</em> he whispered. <em>&quot;I am not your king. Not like this.&quot;</em>

He was prince of someone else. He had seen that, loud and clear. 

He reached out and flipped two cards. One ace of spades, one ace of hearts.</span>

The storm was still raging. But suddenly, he was within the middle of it. He closed his eyes, and chose his next pair. He kept them closed. 

<em>&quot;A match,&quot;</em> he murmured without looking. When he opened his eyes again, they were a mix of purple and red. He didn&#39;t have much of an expression on his face. 

The queen of hearts and spades. 

<em>&quot;And what would your real king do for you.&quot;</em> He replied. His voice was careful, measured.</span>

His fingers chose two cards. He opened his eyes.

Where he had been in the eye of the storm before, it was now whipping around him, consuming him, taking him. He choked, suddenly. His mouth tasted like blood, like he had bitten through his tongue. 

He didn&#39;t choose a card. <em>&quot;I-I did not do this to you,&quot;</em> He breathed, <em>&quot;I- I could never hurt you!&quot;</em>

He had completely forgotten that this was a vision. He was convinced this was real, this game they were playing was all that mattered and if he lost, he lost what was most valuable to him. <em>&quot;S-Something else, s-something else did this, and I- I have to- save you.&quot;</em>

It sounded less like he was trying to convince Yugi, and more trying to convince himself. He reached out. Each card felt like electric shocks burning his fingertips. 

He flipped them. 

A pair of jokers. 

His hands came to his head, hitting the side of it again. <em>&quot;I- I cannot afford to lose-! I- I did not do this to you!&quot;</em>

He held the cards so tightly in his hand they bent. The jokers were kings, princes, laughing and laughing at him. Yami looked up again, trying to find the boy he loved so much in that crimson.</span>

He pulled him over the table, shaking, completely driven by his fear and adrenaline. He held him so close, like he was going to kiss those terrible words from his mouth- and in any other situation, maybe it would have been so. They breathed the same breath together.

<em>&quot;You- You <strong>stole</strong> him, you&#39;re using his body-!&quot;</em> He felt his own third eye glow, so bright it would blind him. <em>&quot;You are deluding me- to keep him away from me! He is <strong>mine,</strong> you cannot have him!&quot;</em>

Tears were spilling down his cheek, a harsh contrast to the fire in his words. 

<em>&quot;F-For stealing what means the most to me-! PENALTY GAME!&quot;</em></span>

(“P-partner…”)

Then he grinned. <em>“I haven’t stolen anything. This is your partner’s future. You can’t run from it much longer!”</em>

(He put his hands over Yami’s as he begged to be seen, begged to be heard.)

But the brighter Yami’s third eye glowed, the dimmer the vision’s third eye became. By the time the words ‘penalty game’ were said, the vision’s third eye was gone completely. 

He began to panic. <em>“N-no! You can’t— You can’t take my king from me! I’m his, you can’t—“</em>

(<em>For your loss, my partner… A penalty game. For your lies, your deception… Enjoy the silence!</em>)

(He began to panic. Tried to pull Yami’s hands off of him. “N-no! I’m right here, partner, there’s no need for a penalty game—!”)

(Yugi had found an empty classroom for privacy before pulling Yami into their inner world. Yami was standing over him, grabbing him by the collar. He’d pulled Yugi close. There was no third eye glowing on his forehead, no red to be found in his eyes. Only tears.)</span>

And it was quiet, and it was suffocating. Yami suddenly wished for the storm, for at least a storm could be an excuse for terror. He wasn&#39;t looking at the vision of his partner, a traitor, a terrible thing trying to hurt him. 

He was looking at Yugi. 

Just, Yugi. 

Yami dropped him. Didn&#39;t move, didn&#39;t breathe, <em>couldn&#39;t</em> breathe. Monsters didn&#39;t need to breathe, devilish, corrupting spirits inside of pure boys did not need to breathe- but his chest started to shake and heave with hiccupping breaths. He breathed out his name, like it was prayer and offering and light- but only his name. Partner, partner was too much, it was a chain on which he was <em>trapping</em> Yugi, and he couldn&#39;t- 

He&#39;d hurt him. He&#39;d tried to give him a penalty game. He&#39;d been so willing to. He was ready to, believing he was <em>saving</em> his partner from this terrible thing. But what had he really accomplished? <em>You&#39;re the one who did this to me.</em> 

Those tears were <em>his</em> fault. That panic was <em>his</em> fault. The fear in his eyes and heart was <em>his</em> fault. <em>I&#39;d do anything for him.</em>

No, no, no. Nothing, nothing should be done for him. He forced himself awake into their body, took the puzzle off his neck and threw it across the room. It clunked, tumbled across the floor, and the last thing Yami saw was the center piece popping out of place.</span>

Suddenly, he was back in their body, staring at…staring at the puzzle on the other side of the room. Broken.

Broken, the way Yugi’s heart felt. He wasn’t whole without his partner. He needed him, but his partner had just thrown the puzzle away—

Yugi pulled his knees up to his chest, wrapped his arms around them and sobbed.

He didn’t understand, couldn’t understand. Was this about the nightmare his partner had? Because Yugi wouldn’t betray Yami for anyone, including the puzzle! He couldn’t think of anything else…

No, he didn’t want to think of anything else. But fears whispered in Yugi’s mind, telling him he was unworthy. Telling him his partner wanted nothing to do with him.

The tears eventually began to slow down. Yugi took one deep breath, then another. He couldn’t… He couldn’t leave the puzzle like that. It was his greatest treasure, he couldn’t…

He crawled over to the puzzle and slotted the center piece into place before putting it around his neck.</span>

&quot;Hey- Yugi?&quot; Joey. He was standing in the door, taking a careful step over to Yugi. &quot;Hey- what&#39;s wrong, man?&quot; He had an idea, but, he didn&#39;t want to assume. Was this still about that weirdness at lunch? Yugi had left without eating at all, saying he had to go do something, and then he never came back to class. 

And there was still nothing. Silent, like an empty night of first snow, cold and untouched.</span>

&quot;Quit actin&#39; like a coward!&quot; He said to it, &quot;You&#39;d better own up to making him cry or I&#39;ll make you! And you won&#39;t like it if I do!&quot;

Joey looked back at Yugi. He took one of his hands, and pulled him out of the classroom, and promptly out of the school. The sun was warm. It was a really nice day out. &quot;You needed to get the hell outta that classroom.&quot;

School was certainly not over yet. They were totally skipping. 

A slight, very slight warmth persisted when Joey let him go. 

Joey leaned against the side of the building. They were just out of view of everyone, so no one would catch them skipping. &quot;...Whatever happened, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll work out. You two always work it out. And if he doesn&#39;t, I&#39;m <em>gonna</em> kick his ass. That&#39;s a promise this time.&quot;</span>

“I hope you’re right, I just… What if I never see him again? What if he wants to forget me? What if he doesn’t want me anymore? Maybe I’m just not good enough… “

He ripped a fistful of grass out of the ground. Now something looked the way he felt.</span>

The fact it was blue, clear, made him pissed off. His best friend was sitting here so damn sad and the sky had the audacity to look happy. At least a storm would make sense. At least a storm would reflect his life. 

&quot;You&#39;re the best anyone&#39;s gonna get. That&#39;s a fact. Better than him in every damn way, if this is how he&#39;s gonna act.&quot;

A breeze passed. The grass in Yugi&#39;s hand fell away. The sunlight cast a shadow of Yugi on the adjacent wall of the building. The shadow was looking back at him. It had no other expression other than its eyes, which were crying golden tears. 

&quot;But if there&#39;s anything I know about that guy,&quot; Joey sighed. &quot;Is he loves you more than he loves himself. Givin&#39; you up would mean givin&#39; himself up. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s keen on that.&quot;</span>

Yugi looked down at the ground again. “Sorry,” he mumbled, “for making you worry about me.”</span>

Joey was totally, one-hundred percent convinced he was right. Even if he was frustrated with the other Yugi, he knew there was good in there. Even if the other Yugi made a <em>lot</em> of fuck ups, he always came through in the end. 

Joey forced himself to not quip that they had been apart for <em>maybe</em> twenty minutes. He had a feeling twenty minutes was a lifetime to them. &quot;Don&#39;t you start apologizin&#39;. You&#39;re my best friend. I&#39;m gonna worry about you cryin&#39; alone in a damn classroom all I want.&quot;

The shadow shifted against the wall. It appeared behind Yugi. There was a cold feeling down his back, around his waist, wispy black curling behind him. A silent ask for forgiveness.</span>

Something about Yugi throwing up in the middle of class so the teacher had asked Joey to take him home. Joey made sure he was all set before heading back out, now needing to bullshit to their teacher about where Yugi was and why Joey had been gone for so long. 

When the door was shut, and they were in his room, the shadow appeared again. He had more features now, and was clearly Yami- just a bit different. The outline of his face was more clear, and you could see he was dressed in Yugi&#39;s outfit. But his hair was a mess, and his eyes still glowed yellow, with those golden tears falling down his cheeks. 

He looked terrible.</span>

Once he was in his room, he sat down on his bed. He looked up at Yami with a tired smile. Even if he looked different, he could see him again, and that meant everything.

“Hey, partner. How are you feeling?” Yugi winced. That was a bad question, the answer to that was kind of obvious. 

“Can we talk? I’m not… It’s okay, I promise. I forgive you. I just want to understand.”</span>

Just a shadow at Yugi&#39;s back, taking over for him when it was deemed necessary, when it was dangerous enough. 

He waved his hands. A deck of cards appeared there, and he fanned them out for Yugi to look at. The deck was only full of kings and jacks, alternating between hearts and spades. He pointed at the King and Jack of hearts, and then at Yugi. Then the King of spades, pointing back at himself. 

Damnit, he just wanted to communicate better than this. That&#39;s what he got, he thought sourly, for acting the way he had. Maybe-?

He pulled out the cards he had gestured to. He sat on the floor in front of Yugi, the three cards in front of him. He paired up the King and Jack of hearts, and the King of spades was alone. The jack was laughing at the king of spades. 

He gestured to his face. He didn&#39;t appear to have a mouth, trying to tell Yugi he <em>would</em> talk if he felt he could. <em>[I DIDN&#39;T MEAN TO]</em></span>

“I know you didn’t mean to.” Yugi looked up at Yami. “Partner, I…” he wanted to reassure he’d never choose the puzzle over Yami, but he was still trying to understand what happened. “Did you…think the puzzle had taken me away from you? Was I…” His face was pale. “Laughing at you?”</span>

But those terrible words. The terrible things that the fake Yugi had said to him. He separated the cards, the Jack of hearts and King of spades across each other. Between them, he put the King of hearts face down. He gestured, and flipped the card between them face up, then back down. Trying to communicate that they were playing a game.

“Concentration?”

He and Yami had been playing a game… The pieces were starting to fall into place. The puzzle had taken him away from Yami, and he and Yami were playing a game. He was starting to understand.

He looked at his partner again. Yugi knew that Yami would never purposefully hurt him. He knew he meant a lot to Yami.  It was obvious how bad Yami felt.

He leaned forward, reached out to hold Yami’s face. “It’s okay, partner. I’ve already forgiven you. I’m so sorry you had to go through that, and… I promise, I will never betray you for the puzzle.”</span>

He gestured. The King and Jack looked at each other. Then, Yami flipped the card, and it was suddenly the Jack of hearts.

Yugi moved backwards on the bed and laid down carefully, making sure to leave room for his partner. He patted the area of the bed next to him. 

“Of course you can lay with me. Come here, my king. You don’t have to comfort me, but…it would be nice, if you wanted to.”

He wouldn’t deny comfort sounded really nice right now.</span>

Even though it was back to being slightly formless, he had to try. His eyes felt heavy, but he fought himself. Yugi needed him, needed him to be good. And he would try.

He rested a hand on Yugi&#39;s cheek, and leaned forward, pressing a kiss to his forehead. <em>&quot;I am sorry for the pain I have caused today. It was not very becoming of me. I-I only feared for your safety. I wanted to protect you, no matter the cost.&quot;</em>

He was still trying to explain, still trying to atone. He wasn&#39;t sure when he would feel like he had earned his forgiveness yet. <em>&quot;I...I love you, more than anything in this world. I would do anything for you. My past, my future- they&#39;re all yours. As long as there is still a place for me among your memories.&quot;</em></span>
