How long had he been locked away like this? Days? Months? Years? It felt like eons no matter what was true. The times where he felt human had long vanished. He felt ethereal, angelic, void of feeling. Numb to the outside. 

He remembered the day The Other came back, he remembered it vividly. He had only met The Other once before in passing, yet he knew that they were always there. They were always where he sat now, watching, waiting in the dark. The false warmth that now ran through his veins was the key to unlocking them. It’s presence was all it took for his guide wires to be severed and handed over to The Other.

Staring forward, his only companion in the darkness was an old CRT monitor. On it’s screen were grayscale images of the outside, flickering past like snippets of channels seen through someone’s TV surfing. There was a boy that showed up on it often, one with lighter colored hair and a look of dread. He felt sorry for them, he wanted to apologize to them. He recognized the hands that often stretched out in front of the camera as his own. The Other was hurting the boy.

Maybe someday, it would be his turn again. To feel human and see the world in the vibrant colors he remembered. Not this dark, monotone, passenger existence the false warmth forced him into. Maybe then he could save them. He felt like he had to. He still remembered his promise made to the boy on the screen.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161861230093406278 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161861230093406278><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 11:01 PM">11:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The hum of the monitor rang loud in his ears, causing him to wince and draw back. Right, thoughts like those were punishable. The Other didn’t like them. Something was different than the other punishments. Was the sound all that time? The Other did not seem busy from what the flipping channels suggested.

But then the surfing stopped, pausing on a feed of a room that he had not seen in a long, long time. He suddenly felt an invisible force come up behind him and grab his head. His mouth opened to let out a yelp, but all that arose was strangled silence. Here was the punishment that he thought wouldn’t come. Maybe it was punishment for underestimating The Other. They didn’t like that either.

With a mighty shove, the invisible force shoved him against the monitor face first. His arms grabbed each side to try and push away, but the little amount of strength he owned was nullified. His eyes were forced open, and they strained to make sense of the lights piercing through the monitor’s shadow mask.

His breath seized upon recognizing the small hands reaching for a knob. They were his own.

A boy peeked through the gap made by his bedroom door. He had been hearing mutterings of conversation. Had his father finally come home after a long day’s work? The male voice sounded too grave for that. His father was a happy, jovial man, even in exhaustion. The boy squinted, trying to look past his mother’s back to make out the figure who stood outside in the darkness.

“No means no, I am truly sorry. Perhaps our neighbors can help you.”

“Ї нavє alяєadџ тґїєd тнєм all, Ma’aм. Џоц aяє му lasт ноpё.”

“… I am so sorry. Please, leave us.” 

The front door started to close, and suddenly the figure’s features became clear to the boy. Fear pooled in his stomach as he recognized himself. It was The Other. At the last second they glanced at the boy, and grinned until they were out of sight.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161861717874196531 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161861717874196531><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 11:03 PM">11:03 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Something felt off. He realized he was carrying a weight. The boy looked down at his hands to see that he was holding an open jug and a box of matches. The fumes of gasoline began to flood his senses, and he watched as his arms started to move on their own. It was only now he realized he was outside, feet covered in snow, and standing by the secluded corner of his own house. Panic started to well up inside him as moonlit fuel cascaded down onto the walls of the house and pooled in grooves and crevices. It would make a wonderful blaze, wouldn’t it? 

No. NO! He began to struggle against the movements. He tried to force himself to stop pouring, but the invisible force had control of his hands. The Other, it was The Other! Not him! It was never him! His eyes burned with tears as the jug emptied before them, and his sight became blurred as the invisible force pulled him backwards to make a trail. No… no… no… this wasn’t how it happened!

His heartbeat roared in his ears as the sound of a striking match made him quiver. His strength was expended, and his tears were delicately wiped away by the being that controlled him. It forced him to hold the small flame up for inspection, then made him release it from his hand. It caught on the trail of gasoline with ease, and as blue wisps of fire silently travelled along it, a whisper graced his ears. 

“Їт шas џоц… џоц caцsёd їт all…”

Badump. Badump. Badump. His heart kept pounding in his ears as the flames caught onto their target and turned from blue to gold. Tears dripped off his jaw and silently fell into the snow as the invisible being forced to watch the fire licked and engulfed his home. It all seemed to happen so quickly, like a time-lapse. There were screams, then a far too familiar shriek, then a name called out as silhouettes hurried to the scene. 

“Яци… џоц’ll gёт caцgнт.” The whispers urged.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161862291218767893 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161862291218767893><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 11:05 PM">11:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Footsteps, for once they were not his own, but they were closing in. The invisible force let him go, and he stumbled before finding the coordination needed to run. Badump! Badump! Badump! Badump! His heart seemed to echo the quick pace of his step. The heat of the blaze began to vanish, and he squeezed his eyes shut and attempted to yell out. Stop it. Stop it! This wasn’t right!

Again, silence. Deafening silence. Right, he remembered. Ever since coming here, he didn’t have a voice. The Other had taken it from him. He collapsed to the ground and slowly wrapped his hands around his throat. Acceptance is what The Other wanted him to fall into, and as guilt started to pull, the clenching of his throat grew tighter… and tighter… punishing himself for falling into The Other’s punishment yet again. 

With a shudder and gasp of air, he opened his eyes. 

His only companion in the darkness was an old CRT monitor. On it’s screen were grayscale images of his face, flickering past like snippets of channels seen through someone’s TV surfing. Each channel had a different expression. Their lips moved like a flipbook, each one a frame in the larger narrative. He laid on the floor there, staring at them with eyes dark and devoid of purpose. The whisper came back, and dubbed itself over the images. 

“Шнџ dо џоц dо тнїs то мє? Jцšт adмїт џоцґ gцїlт оf тнїš lasт cґїмё– уоця fїґšт cяїмё– aиd їт шїll all вё оvєя. Уоця ґєfцsal Ьяїиgš цs paїи. Ї тноцgнт уоц шaитёd то pяотёcт цs?”

He didn’t understand. As he continued to stare at the screen, his mind dared to think. He never really cared much about protecting himself. Self-perseverance was only ever a means to continue living for someone else. With everything else gone, there wasn’t much reason to keep going.

The surfing stopped, pausing on a channel that showed great dissatisfaction. The whisper grew louder, and angrier.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161862657473773578 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161862657473773578><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 11:07 PM">11:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Tнёи шнџ?! Tнєґё їs иотнїиg lёfт fоя џоц иош, џёт џоц sтїll яёfцsё то facє тнє тґцтн.”

He knew his thoughts would greatly upset The Other. It was simple: it wasn’t the truth. That, and he still had a sliver of hope that his time outside wasn’t over. 

The monitor switched off, allowing for the darkness to swallow him. He could feel his eyes ache from the constant strain of watching it. In a way, it felt good. The simple relief of not having to watch the horrors of outside was reason enough to embrace the darkness. 

But then the darkness turned white. He cowered at the brightness, attempting to curl up and cover his eyes. However something stopped him. It felt like the invisible force was holding him down. They were trying to force his eyes open, but the fingers that tried felt too real. He could feel cloth, a glove. 

“Оpєи уоцґ ёуєs.” The voice was right in front of him. “ОЬєџ мє!”

He had no choice. His eyes opened to find himself staring back, straddling him and wearing black. That sliver of relief was gone, replaced by mounting dread as The Other held his head still. Their fingers moved from his around his eyes and pressed against his temples. 

“Їs їт Ьєcaцsё уоц aґё fояgєттїиg? Dо уоц иєєd то ґємємЬєя шну уоц aяё a šcцм?” They spoke, leaning forward to press their forehead against his. Their eyes were too familiar to him, as if he was looking in a mirror. Their smile was sickeningly sweet as they passed a thumb across his cheek. 

“Lєт’s тaкё a тґїp tо яёмїиd уоц оf шнaт џоц нavє dоиє то цs то caцsє all тнїs.”

Suddenly his vision cut out, and his body jolted as static took it’s place. Salt and pepper rushed around wherever he could look, and the sound made him mouth in pain. He couldn’t lift his hands to cover them. He felt the fabric of gloves also gripping his wrists.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161863017995182090 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161863017995182090><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 11:08 PM">11:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His thoughts– the only thing he had left– were taken from him. He could feel The Other combing through them to get to his memories. It was horrifying, it was agonizing. His body convulsed under The Other’s hold. 

Finally the static wiped away to a first person account of himself filling out forms. Of himself lying about his age to get into the military. The channel flipped, now he was slamming his fist down next to a PET. The navi inside was staring soullessly at him. A channel flip. His fist was flying into another youth’s stomach. They were wearing orange. Another channel flip, this time he was staring at his PET. The navi on the screen was killing infected innocents, as per his orders. Yet another. A paralyzing jolt of electricity as he gripped onto the before youth mid jump. Flip. Lunging towards a familiar darkened navi and then being flung by an explosion after critical failure. 

The channels started to flip faster, the recalls began to meld. Pushing buttons, missiles firing, slotting battle chips, thousands of spears, a long time friend, royalty, broken ankle, falling, a flutter in his chest. Mining rig, demolished towns, overwhelming anger, shoving her, bombardment, alien, battle, someone screaming his name, space, pain. Electric shock, falling, temporal shift, falling, desert heat, blue hood, frustration, red and white, high five, electric shock, failure, clawing at the ground. Vines, phantoms, false friends, swords to the stomach, nightmares, red, smile, new year, dates, laughter, warehouse, fire, darkness, The Other, needles, stress tests, fists, overdose, death, haze, struggle, depression, hacking, deceit, selfishness– 

His body began to tremble. His legs weakly thrashed about as it became more about holding on and less about taking in the overabundance of information. His fingers flexed and curled in attempts to find something to hold onto, but it was too late.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1161863198891323524 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1161863198891323524><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, October 11, 2023 11:09 PM">11:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Suddenly he stilled, and went limp in The Other’s hold. They let go of him and sat up, their expression stoic. 

“Яємёмвєґ иош?”

No answer, which The Other took as a yes. Darkness returned and they vanished, leaving him to lay there until he came back around.

He had lost sense of time again, just like before. How long had he been locked away like this? Days? Months? Years? It felt like eons no matter how he thought. The times where He felt human had long vanished. He felt ethereal, angelic, void of feeling. Numb to the outside. 

Perhaps it was time to be numb on the inside, too.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
