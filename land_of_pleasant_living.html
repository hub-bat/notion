<em>It has to be here somewhere.</em> He thought sourly. Unlike <em>him,</em> he couldn&#39;t control the volume of his thoughts. They likely boomed much too loudly. He gripped onto the puzzle&#39;s chain, as if it would show him the way to what he was looking for. The artifacts of lost kings started to pass by. Yes...He was on the right track.</span>

<em>&quot;I cannot ignore their pull much longer. There is something at the edges of my vision that I must see fully.&quot;</em> This time, he did look at Yugi. His eyes were different. Not like usual- something darker in them. And his third eye glowed bright.

Yugi looked up at him. He was different, scarier. He took a step back, away from the case.

“I thought— We talked about this, at the hospital. I thought you didn’t want to find your memories. I told you you could have mine instead…”

He tapped his fingertips together. This was sudden. He thought his other self was happy as things were. Why was this happening now?</span>

Did Yami feel…trapped with him? Was Yami unhappy? Were Yugi’s memories not enough, was <em>Yugi</em> not enough?

But…no. Something wasn’t right.

“I don’t want you trapped,” he repeated. He took a step closer to him.  “But you’re acting weird. You’re not usually like this anymore, you’re not this mean. Not to me. What’s going on? Can’t we talk about this? I want to understand.”</span>

Yami did not look right. His form was not the way it always appeared in their joined space- sort of creepy, but softer around the edges. Here, he looked just as he did out of here. Blank expression with terribly angry eyes.

<em>&quot;So be it. But will you be able to handle it?&quot;</em>

A pair of dice appeared in his hands. <em>&quot;We will roll the dice. The highest roller is the winner of the round. The loser...&quot;</em>

In his other hand, a knife. <em>&quot;Must inflict a wound on the other. The higher the number they rolled, the deeper the wound must be. The first player who is unable to follow up with the penalty is the loser of the game.&quot;</em>

His voice was flat. He thought that Yugi would not be able to handle this game, and he would have his submission. But he was confident, too, that he could win.</span>

They’d practiced these kinds of shadow games, though. Yugi had been able to defeat Yami then. Could he do it now?

He had to, in order to understand what was going on.

His eyes flickered to Yugi. At that moment, there was the faintest quirk in his expression. A smile?

And when the dice returned, and rolled for a moment, it did blossom. Yugi rolled in return a 9. Shy of matching his roll. <em>&quot;I expected more from the one chosen by the puzzle.&quot;</em>

He stepped forward, took Yugi&#39;s arm. Pushing up his sleeve, he smoothed his hand over Yugi&#39;s perfect skin. He took the knife and slashed down his forearm. It bled profusely, hitting a vein. Not enough to kill him, but enough to hurt- possibly make him dizzy as time passed. 

<em>&quot;You&#39;ll have to roll perfectly the next time.&quot;</em> And he pressed the dice into his bloody hand. The knife was left in the center, equidistant between the two of them.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yugi <em>screamed</em> as the knife sliced through his skin. He pressed his other hand against the wound, trying in vain to get the bleeding to stop. He stared up at his other self, tears in his eyes.

The wound hurt, but the fact that it came from Yami hurt him more. The one he loved… He trusted Yami. He had to figure out why Yami was doing this.

Yugi gripped the dice harshly, staining them with blood. He bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from screaming more, to distract himself from the pain, keep himself grounded. Now wasn’t the time to show weakness. He could scream and cry later, after he’d won.

And it was when, not if, he won. He believed in himself, his own ability to succeed. He’d beaten Yami in these games before, he could do it again.

He rolled the dice again. They landed at a 10. A pretty good roll, better than his previous roll. But was it good enough?

His other self’s roll came in at a 6. 

Yugi couldn’t even allow himself to feel relieved, though. Winning the dice roll meant…

He picked up the knife, blood from his hand dripping off the handle. He looked back up at his other self. He couldn’t bring himself to hurt him too badly, but he had to do something…

Yugi took Yami’s hand in his, held it so Yami’s palm faced upwards. Carefully, slowly, deliberately, he cut into Yami’s thumb enough to draw blood. Yugi winced as the wound began to bleed.

He looked to the wound on his own arm. He felt the slightest bit unsteady, but for now he was okay. Letting go of his other self’s hand, he moved his own hand to cover the wound again. 

Yugi didn’t look back up. He couldn’t look his other self in the eyes.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yami didn&#39;t react when he was cut. It was the result of the game. The pain was negligible. 

He took the dice, and rolled. 8. It was low, but- 

His confidence didn&#39;t waver. Yugi&#39;s roll was a 7. Just one off. <em>&quot;The gods smile upon me,&quot;</em> He said, and raised the knife. Their blood had mingled, staining it. Poetic, he thought. He grabbed Yugi&#39;s chin, and the knife pressed to his cheek-

<em>&quot;NO!&quot;</em>

The sound tore from his throat and made him stumble back. Yami grabbed his head like his head was about to split open. <em>&quot;Y-You will not- Hurt him!&quot;</em> 

The knife was turned, and drove down into Yami&#39;s leg. He crumbled to the floor. A growl, calling <em>Why why why why are you winning against me?!</em>

And the response, <em>Because you are dominated by your hatred.</em>

Yami looked up. His third eye no longer glowed. <em>&quot;P-Partner,&quot;</em> He breathed. <em>&quot;O-Oh partner,&quot;</em> 

He wanted to reach for him, wanted to grab him up in his arms, but he couldn&#39;t. He had <em>hurt</em> him. He watched as his body had done just what he feared. Despite the reassurance, fate came knocking on his door and he was powerless to lock it behind him. 

His vision blurred. He thought it was blood loss, but instead tears fell down his cheeks. He didn&#39;t know he was crying. <em>&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot;</em> he rasped. 

And then the world melted away. Yami woke up in the museum. It was still dark out, the moon risen high in the night&#39;s sky. 

He found broken glass, and his body cut. Down his arm, his palm- and the larger shard driven into his leg. His breaths shuttered. Fear grew colder, deeper. He had hurt him...for real, outside of the shadow game. He had to get out of here. He had to get out of here. 

<em>&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Partner-&quot;</em> He pushed himself up. He shook as he stood, limping the way he came. This time, it was blood loss making his vision blurry. 

<em>Joey,</em> He thought. <em>Joey will help him.</em>

Payphone, needed a payphone...</span>

Crying, Yugi reached out towards his partner. He <em>knew</em> something had been wrong. He reached out desperately, but—

The world melted away. They were back in the museum. Yugi stared at the shards of glass, the wounds covering Yami’s body.

It was all…real… Outside the shadow game, they…

Yami was already moving. Yugi ran to catch up with him, even though it wasn’t necessary. 

“Partner, please, talk to me!”</span>

Thank god, bless Yugi for helping with his memory, for he could remember what to punch in to talk to Joey. The thought ached. Yugi. 

<em>&quot;I need to speak to Joey,&quot;</em> He said, his voice perfect. The man on the phone grumbled out something unintelligible, and then the phone was passed. 

<em>&quot;&#39;Yello? Who&#39;s this?&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Joey,&quot;</em> and his facade broke, his voice choking on his name. <em>&quot;I n-need your help.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Yugi-? Where the hell you at? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</em>

Yami grit his teeth. He felt blood dripping a pool around his feet. He didn&#39;t have much time, he needed to wrap these up. <em>&quot;I-I&#39;m in a payphone, near the museum. P-Please hurry. I&#39;m hurt.&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Shit- awright, I&#39;m on my way!&quot;</em>

The phone was tossed. Yami slid down the side of the payphone, and took off their jacket. He wrapped it around his arm, putting pressure on the wound. He breathed slowly, focusing on each in, out. 

He didn&#39;t let Yugi near the front. He would shoulder this pain...for now. 

<em>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot;</em> He breathed. The vision of Yugi nearly made his heart break. <em>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry, Yugi. I&#39;ll make this right. I&#39;ll- I&#39;ll fix this.&quot;</em>

His eyelids fluttered. He wasn&#39;t passed out yet, but it felt soon. He locked his jaw. He had to hold on.</span>

All he could do was watch as Yami made the call. That was good— They did need help, but…

As Yami slid down, Yugi kneeled down beside him. Tears filled his eyes. He reached for the shoulder of Yami’s uninjured arm.

“Partner, please, hold on! Stay with me!” If Yami wasn’t going to respond to him, the best he could do was try to keep Yami from passing out. “I don’t know what’s going on with you, but we’ll figure this out. Just, please, stay awake…”

Tears spilled down his cheeks. He wiped them away with his arm.

Joey would be here soon, and Yami would be okay, and then Yugi and Yami would talk, and…</span>

<em>&quot;Partner,&quot;</em> He reached up as if to cup the face of Yugi&#39;s vision, like he had done so many times before. <em>&quot;I was not...I was not lying, when I said, I only want...memories...if they&#39;re with you.&quot;</em> 

He wanted to say more. Wanted to explain everything he knew-

&quot;Jesus- Yugi!&quot;

But he was out of time. Yami reached up and waved his hand, and Joey helped him up to standing. &quot;What the hell happened to you?!&quot;

<em>&quot;Home,&quot;</em> He mumbled, <em>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you at home.&quot;</em>

Joey&#39;s expression changed a little. He recognized the different tone the &quot;other&quot; Yugi took. &quot;Alright. But you better explain.&quot;

Yami dipped his head. He let Joey take him home. And Joey was so thoughtful, when they got back to the shop, he took the back entrance and carried Yami all the way up, narrowly avoiding the eyes of Solomon or his mother. He laid Yami out on the bed.

&quot;You&#39;re fucking nuts, you know that?&quot;

It was in jest. Yami still felt his heart twist. Joey retrieved the first aid kit from their bathroom and started tending to his cuts. The shard of glass...that needed stitches. 

<em>&quot;Joey,&quot;</em> Yami mumbled. Joey was applying disinfectant to his hand. <em>&quot;I need you to do me a favor.&quot;</em>

&quot;Another one? You&#39;re really wrackin&#39; it up-&quot;

Yami breathed in. He pushed Yugi from his conciousness, pushing him back so he wouldn&#39;t see what he was about to do.

His hand came up. He removed the puzzle from around his neck. 

<em>&quot;Please take this. Smash it.&quot;</em>

 &quot;W-What?&quot;

<em>&quot;I have caused great harm to the one I care for the most. If it is out of my control, I do not want to be here to harm him more. You and the others- you are of pure hearts. You will take care of him.&quot;</em>

Joey went to reply, but Yami pushed the puzzle into his hands. He held his own hand over Joey&#39;s. 

<em>&quot;I know you&#39;ll do the right thing.&quot;</em>

And he let go, dropping the puzzle into Joey&#39;s hands. His presence left, and Yugi was left in their pain-riddled, bloody body.</span>

One moment, Yugi was watching Joey take care of Yami, take care of their body. And the next—

It was a struggle not to scream in pain. It hurt, it hurt so bad, his arm and his hand and his leg… 

It hurt so badly he didn’t notice the puzzle was gone from around his neck.

He nearly screamed, but he didn’t. Yugi couldn’t alert his family, he felt bad enough that Joey had to help him, and…

Something was missing. 

“Partner?“ Yugi looked around wildly, tears flowing openly. He couldn’t feel Yami’s presence anymore. “Partner, where are you?”

He looked to Joey. “Joey—“ He moved in just the wrong way, and it was a struggle not to scream again. Where was his partner?</span>

Joey didn&#39;t know what the hell was going on. Yami didn&#39;t give him the explanation he had been waiting for. But he had to focus on getting Yugi patched up. He moved onto his arm, cleaning that up and wrapping it up in gauze. 

&quot;Keep it straight. Don&#39;t move.&quot;

Then his leg. God. This one was going to be bad. He set down the first aid kit. If getting in constant fights taught him anything- it was how to patch things up. The shard wasn&#39;t too big, and it was in one piece. 

He pulled the pillowcase off of Yugi&#39;s pillow. &quot;This is going to hurt. Bad. Put this in your mouth so you don&#39;t bite through your tongue.&quot;

He balled it up and put it in his mouth. His other hand gripped Yugi&#39;s. &quot;On three.&quot;

There was no real elegant way to do this. Joey put his hand around the shard, and pulled. He didn&#39;t pull on three.

He quickly moved to dress and clean the wound. It needed stitches, but this first aid kit didn&#39;t have that. It would have to stand for now. &quot;You&#39;re gonna be fine.&quot;</span>

Getting the shard pulled out of his leg was painful. Joey wasn’t lying. Yugi still managed not to scream, though he came really close. He breathed through the pain, forcing himself not to move.

“Partner…” He closed his eyes. “Where did you go…?”</span>

&quot;Yugi, what the hell happened? What is that partner of yours getting you into?&quot;

He opened his eyes, stared at Joey. “It’s not his fault! I know it’s not…” He answered the question like Joey had accused Yami of attacking Yugi himself. (Which, to be fair, wasn’t far off from the truth). “Something’s wrong with him, he wasn’t acting like himself. He said he was looking for his memories. We played a shadow game.” Yugi sniffed. “But he told me the only memories he cares about are the ones he makes with me…”

He was too worried and in too much pain, it made giving a straightforward answer hard.</span>

He picked up the puzzle. Held it just out of Yugi&#39;s reach. 

&quot;Your partner told me to smash this. Said he didn&#39;t want to hurt you more.&quot; 

He reached over, and set it on Yugi&#39;s desk. &quot;I&#39;m not making any decisions till I get what the hell was going on. <em>Did he hurt you?</em> &quot;

Joey looked pointedly at the puzzle, then back at Yugi. &quot;Cause if he did, I&#39;ve got some real damn harsh words to say!&quot;

He wasn&#39;t going to break it. But they needed to be apart for a minute- at least, in Joey&#39;s eyes.</span>

“Please don’t smash it…”

When it was sat on the desk, his arm fell back to his side. 

What did he tell Joey? The truth? But that meant admitting it was true. What he wanted to be true? But that meant lying to his best friend…and he couldn’t do that.

He stared down at his injured arm, the arm Yami had sliced open with his own hands. “He…he did…”

It wasn’t Yami’s fault, Yugi knew it wasn’t, but that didn’t change the facts, did it? It still happened.

Tears fell down his face faster. All the hurt and confusion and fear and his wounded self esteem, he let it start flowing out of him.

“Please don’t…please don’t smash it…”</span>

But he couldn&#39;t. Because while his best friend was laying on that bed...His other best friend was in that puzzle. He grumbled. &quot;You two are a handful. There better be a good damn reason for this.&quot;

He picked up the puzzle. &quot;You hear me in there? If I find out there wasn&#39;t a good reason for this fuss, I&#39;m gonna do a lot worse to you than just yell at you!&quot;

He looked back at Yugi. 

&quot;I&#39;d never smash this. I&#39;m going to go wash my hands and see if I can find something for how bad you&#39;re feeling. You two better have talked this out by the time I get back.&quot;

Carefully, he looped the puzzle back around his neck. The warmth returned immediately. 

&quot;And if you need help, scream. I&#39;ll handle your folks.&quot;

He slipped out of the room, wandering into their bathroom. God, his hands were bloody. 

Yami didn&#39;t say anything. His presence was there, but he didn&#39;t say anything. Didn&#39;t show himself.</span>

He didn&#39;t speak for a while, didn&#39;t even look at Yugi. He was trying to formulate what he needed to say. 

A deck of cards appeared in his hands. He shuffled. 

<em>&quot;My dream came true. I...&quot;</em> He dropped a few cards. It wasn&#39;t like him. He picked them up. <em>&quot;Something came over me. Some instinct...I have felt it from within the puzzle for a long time. It was just a buzz in the background...But...&quot;</em>

They had heard about the new exhibit at school or whatever. Since then, that buzz had turned into a roar. A demand to search for this King&#39;s memories. 

<em>&quot;It overpowered me. I needed to find those memories. I- I do not remember what happened. I do not remember hurting your body.&quot;</em>

After he had vowed to learn to care for it. He started weaving the cards, placing them in the table in different stacks. Again, it wasn&#39;t like him. It showed his stress. 

<em>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. There is no excuse for hurting you in this way. I asked Joey to...take care of it, but...&quot;</em>

He knew it was too much. A drop of false blood covered a face up card. The ace.</span>

Yugi stared at Yami, tears still in his eyes.

“I know it’s not your fault… The way you were acting, it wasn’t like you… You called me your servant, commanded me to obey… I even said I would, if you won the game… But before, you said I was your prince. Not a servant.”

He reached his uninjured hand up to brush against his own cheek, the cheek that Yami had nearly cut into.

“I guess…my memories weren’t good enough after all, huh…?”

He blinked away his tears. Forced himself not to be sad or upset. The tears came back anyway.

“If you really need to find those memories…we can look for them. It’s okay, really…”

This was bigger than just Yugi, wasn’t it? His own feelings about it all didn’t matter. He should be able to push past it.

After all, he was just a servant to the king.</span>

He knelt beside the bed. Rubbed his own eyes. <em>&quot;Your memories are worth more than what I deserve, clearly.&quot;</em>

He felt terrible. Felt like he could wretch into the carpet. He closed his eyes, focused his presence. The least he could do was numb Yugi&#39;s physical pain. He took on all of it- the terrible sting in his leg, the ache in his arm. He took it all. It was the least he could do for him. 

<em>&quot;If I had felt in control, I would have never hurt you. I do not know what possessed me to put you in danger.&quot;</em>

He looked back up. Yugi needed to see his sincerity. 

<em>&quot;Your memories...You...You&#39;re all I ever have wanted. Will ever want. But I have shown I clearly do not deserve a soul as bright, as pure as yours.&quot;</em> He forced himself to keep staring. So Yugi would know he was not lying.</span>

And he did. He trusted Yami completely.

Yugi couldn’t help it. The idea that Yami preferred him over those memories made him happy. He smiled, a little.

“You’re all I’ve ever wanted…all I ever will want…you are, too..” He looked towards Yami. Held out his injured hand towards him. “But I’m not as pure as you think. I hurt you, too. I did this.” He glanced briefly at his hand, then back to Yami. “I participated in the game…”

Even with Yami taking on the pain, he was exhausted. His body was in rough shape, and his emotions had been on a rollercoaster since waking up in the museum. Yugi’s eyes closed briefly, before opening again.

“I don’t think…something outside your control should determine what you deserve. You protect me, keep me out of danger, prevent me from getting hurt… You’re the best partner I could ever have. You’re the one I want. And even if you don’t deserve that…I’m not changing my mind. It’s already made.”</span>

Yami sat up straight. That was a voice he didn&#39;t know- he looked around the room, but no one was there. The puzzle, though, was hot. He touched his own. 

<em>[Your beloved did not harm you. I used him for my own gain. There will come a day where you must search for my lost memories. But...There is much to learn, yet. I apologize for my intrusion.]</em>

And then the voice was gone. Yami blinked, wide eyed. <em>&quot;...The voice of the puzzle,&quot;</em> He murmured softly. He opened his mouth to talk again, but Joey rounded the corner. 

&quot;Awright. You kiss and make up, yet?&quot; He folded his arms, leaning on the doorframe. &quot;I found some...Tylenol. That&#39;s about it. Y&#39;all really don&#39;t keep your medicine cabinet stocked.&quot;

Yami looked back at Yugi. He reached down and took Yugi&#39;s hand. <em>&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry. Please forgive me.&quot;</em></span>

It wasn’t Yami’s fault. Yami hadn’t been the one to hurt him.

Yugi began to cry again, though this time, his tears were happy.

He offered Joey a smile. “Tylenol’s plenty. Thank you.” He was surprised they had even that, honestly. 

Then, all his attention went back to Yami. “There’s nothing to forgive, partner. But if it helps, then I forgive you. Please, don’t leave me…”</span>

Joey approached. &quot;Well, er...I think it&#39;s still in date.&quot; He had a glass of water in his other hand. He pushed a few pills into his hand. &quot;Everything better now? Jeez, you always cry so much...&quot;

Joey reached out and wiped the tears from Yugi&#39;s face. There was worry in his expression- rare, even for him. &quot;You alright? I can take you to the hospital, if you don&#39;t feel okay. Can&#39;t go dyin&#39; on me, we have a test next week and ya promised you&#39;d help me study.&quot;

Yami looked up at Joey. There was mild adoration in his eyes. Joey was doing what Yami couldn&#39;t.</span>

Joey pulled Yugi&#39;s desk chair over to sit beside the bed. It was clear he wasn&#39;t going to leave- how the hell could he? Man, and Yugi&#39;s sheets were all messed up...

Yami had shifted, appearing now beside Yugi in bed. He was laying on his good side, eyes loosely shut. While Yugi now seemed content, Yami was still battling a storm in his own mind. His exhaustion was keeping him from being able to hide it from Yugi. Even if the puzzle had influenced him, he hadn&#39;t been strong enough to keep Yugi safe. It was his hands that had guided broken glass to cut perfect skin, said terrible things to him...

He felt as though he could vow &quot;never again&quot; up and down, yet it was out of his control. All he wanted was safety, peace. But somehow he was still bringing chaos knocking on their door. 

Joey&#39;s eyes had fallen on the puzzle again, with a thoughtful look. &quot;You two talked, then?&quot; He finally prodded, folding his arms. &quot;Can you tell me what happened now?&quot;

Yami looked up at Yugi. <em>You do not have to, yet. I could tell him.</em> 

Anything for his prince. Anything to right these wrongs.</span>

He looked over to Yami, frowned. His partner seemed so conflicted. How could he place the burden of telling Joey on him? Yami needed time to process. The least Yugi could do was tell Joey the truth.

“I can do it, partner… It’s okay.”

Joey had helped them so much. He deserved to know.

Yugi shifted, looked over at Joey. “We talked.” He tapped the fingers of his good hand against the bed slowly, one finger at a time. 

“I woke up in the museum. He said he was looking for his memories. Which was strange, because…he told me before the only memories he cares about are the memories he makes with me.” Yugi shook his head. “It wasn’t him. The puzzle was influencing him to look for those memories. None of it was his fault.

“He told me it was my responsibility to help him find his memories. He…he choked me. I didn’t understand why he wanted to look. He said if I wouldn’t help him, we’d play a shadow game, and I…agreed to it. We played a game. The winner of each round had to hurt the loser with a knife, until one of us couldn’t do it anymore. He…he stopped himself from hurting me. I won the game. And then he left the museum and got your help.” Yugi forced himself not to cry again. “It’s not his fault, Joey. Please don’t blame him. It’s not his fault.”</span>

His own false injuries ached. The striking thought that he deserved to be in this pain was loud, and echoed in his mind. He dipped his head. 

&quot;Jeez...You two are a handful.&quot; Joey leaned back and ran his hand through his hair. &quot;I knew that puzzle was cursed. Fucked up little games...&quot;

It was a half joke. Joey let out a small laugh. &quot;Well, you&#39;re not dead, and now we know what to look out for, so...I guess I can&#39;t be too mad at the other Yugi, if it wasn&#39;t his fault.&quot;

Yami raised his head. 

&quot;But if I hear about this again, I&#39;m kicking your ass. I&#39;ll make you remember that.&quot; Yami managed a small smile. <em>I&#39;ll welcome it.</em></span>

That did crack another smile on Yami&#39;s face. He was quiet after that. Joey continued, &quot;You woulda won. You&#39;re the best at games...even if they&#39;re a little fucked up.&quot;

Yami sighed, <em>&quot;You beat me in a game before. You are better than you think. It should have never happened in the first place.&quot;</em> And that was that, his tone very final. He was very much stuck in the mud on this- Yugi&#39;s praise wasn&#39;t getting through the rolling clouds. 

Joey yawned. &quot;I&#39;m staying the night. If ya&#39;ll have another problem, then, I better be here.&quot; He got up and went to their closet, pulling out the sleeping bag he had started to stash here. &quot;And there&#39;s no arguing with that.&quot; He threw it out on the ground, next to Yugi&#39;s bed.</span>

The puzzle said it had made a mistake. That there was still time before they had to find the king’s memories. Surely they were safe for the night at least, then. 

But still, Joey’s presence was always welcome. Yugi was always happy to have a sleepover, even if they happened because he needed to be bandaged up after a game. Friends made every situation better, even situations like this.</span>

Joey stretched out over the sleeping bag, folding his arms behind his head. He really could sleep anywhere. &quot;Get some sleep. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re tired.&quot;

And after their shared goodnights, Joey was snoozing with a quiet snore. Once he had fallen asleep, and the room was dark, Yami sat up next to Yugi. He wasn&#39;t sleeping yet. 

<em>I am sorry, partner.</em> 

It was the first time since they got home that he had said the word- their word- partner. The last time he had said it was in the phone booth. His eyes seemed to glow softly in the night. There was more he wanted to say, but- he couldn&#39;t form it. The thunder clouded his mind, trapping him in this dark fog. The torrential rain was cold.</span>

“It’s okay, partner…”

With Joey asleep, he kept his voice to a whisper. He’d put Joey through a lot tonight, the least he could do was let him sleep.

Hearing ‘partner’ again made his heart leap. After not hearing it for such a long time, he remembered again how happy it made him to hear. To know that they were partners. Even after everything they’d been through tonight.

“I don’t blame you for any of it… I’m not upset. And I’m okay now. So you don’t need to worry…”</span>

It was worth it. Yugi would go through tonight thousands of times for his partner.

“I’m no one’s servant,” he agreed. “I won’t let anyone turn me into one. If tonight was supposed to be destiny, I’ll fight against it as many times as it takes.”</span>

How strong his partner was, how wonderful he was, how <em>brave</em> he was- everything filling in the cracks of what Yami was beginning to falter in, lack. A nagging voice in the back of his head told him that meant his usefulness was up. 

The love for his partner, thankfully, outweighed the voice. He was so proud of him. But the night still weighed on him, like he was going to drown. He forced himself to stop crying. 

<em>I would rather- I would,</em> He sighed, trying to find the right words. Words, words, he was always missing the words to say what he really meant. But these emotions were too great to let Yugi feel in their fullest- too dark for such a gentle soul. <em>I do not want you to live fighting against destiny. Your life does not need to be full of conflict...You hate conflict.</em>

He always had. That was why Yami always handled it for him, pulled him back, protected him. But now he was the aggressor. He was the one who put him in danger. <em>I feel this terrible guilt, partner. I feel as though I should run away from you, when all I want is to be near you. I feel like my skin is made of knives, and if I touch you, I will make you bleed again.</em>

It was intense. But it was all he had the words for, the only way he knew how to communicate these things. Dramatic, but, decidedly him.</span>

But, he supposed Yami had a point. If Yugi had the choice, he didn’t want to live his life in conflict. He just wanted to live his life happily, with his partner. Was that too much to ask? It was, apparently.

“Partner…” Yugi reached out towards Yami again. “You weren’t in control… And I’m not as strong as you are, but I’m not fragile. I won’t break if you touch me. You can still be near me. I still want to be near you. I’ll be okay, as long as we’re together.”</span>

His partner could be covered in mud or something even worse, and to Yugi, there would still never be anyone as beautiful as he was.

“Thank you…” His cheeks turned pink at the praise. “You’re right, I guess it did pay off. I won…” He really had beaten his partner in a game, outside of a practice scenario. “But I had a good partner to train with. I’m glad we trained together.”

He couldn’t help but wonder if he’d benefit from more training. More practice, to build up his pain tolerance if nothing else. But now wasn’t the time to bring it up. Now wasn’t the time to suggest his partner put him through even more pain.</span>

He hated to think of it. Hated to think of having to up the severity just to make sure that no one else could truly hurt him...Or he himself couldn&#39;t. 

Yami rolled over and hovered over Yugi. One by one, he kissed each painful place. The cheek he nearly cut. His hand, his arm. He even shifted down to kiss the bandages on his thigh. 

<em>I am sorry that you must carry these wounds for my failures. I will have to make it right.</em> And he made his way back up, leaving a small peppering of kisses near each injury.</span>

His face growing redder, Yugi hummed happily as his injuries were kissed. He let out a happy sigh.

“It’s alright. I don’t mind. They already feel a lot better… I’m sure they’ll heal fast.”

If Yami really felt like he had to make things right… Yugi didn’t feel like Yami had to, but Yugi was sure Yami could do it. If anyone could do it, it was his partner.</span>
