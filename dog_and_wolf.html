Atoms are made of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Protons have a positive charge, and electrons have a negative charge...&quot; He began pointing to different elements on the periodic table, rambling about the correlation between atomic number and atom mass, and what exactly the atoms of different elements were made of.</span>

For a moment, Yugi was confused. The museum, that was where that shadow game had happened, why did Yami want to go back? Hadn’t they agreed Yami didn’t want to—

The kiss soothed his mind, soothed his heart. There was nothing to worry about. He was happy to go wherever Yami wanted. Surely he had a good reason to want to see the exhibit.

Once they pulled away from the kiss, Yugi smiled up at Yami. “Anywhere you want to go, I’d love to go with you, partner.” He changed their course, leading them towards the museum.</span>

It was familiar inside- all too much, maybe. But Yami wouldn&#39;t let Yugi meditate on it long, distracting him with kind words and soft affections. Innocent &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;ahh&quot; at the different displays. The lights were low in here, casting an orange glow on everything. Like the sun was setting all over again. <em>It&#39;s so nice to see our history, my prince~</em> He hummed, wrapping his arms around Yugi&#39;s shoulders. <em>Wouldn&#39;t you agree?</em></span>

He let go, and approached the tablet, trying to make out the shapes on it. It was still too difficult to see. He turned back to Yugi, still smiling. It seemed like they were the only two in the whole world at the moment. 

He took his hands, pulled him in closer. <em>Wouldn&#39;t you like to find it with me? To help your king?</em> Before he could answer properly, he tipped his chin and pressed another kiss to his lips.</span>

As he looked up at the tablet, those bad memories came back full force. Yami, looking for his memories. A shadow game gone wrong, that they came out of hurt and wounded. The brief image of Yami casting him aside for the other Yugi filled his mind as well.

The kiss did distract him from it all, tried to push the memories away, but it wasn’t enough. They were too close to the tablet to forget, now. Yugi pulled away from Yami and took a step back. “This isn’t right,” he muttered, mostly to himself. “You don’t want these memories, you just want to make new ones with me…”</span>

He stared up at Yami’s eyes, shivered again as he noticed their hue. It was so tempting to agree to, anything to make his partner happy. New memories could be made alongside the old. But Yugi was no ruler. This wasn’t right. This wasn’t right.

There was one constant after these moments that haunted him: Yami’s assurances that he didn’t care for the memories of a king. This was the puzzle again. It had to be.

“Partner, please. You don’t want this, I know you don’t. Let’s go home, please.” Before this turned into another Shadow Game, they needed to leave. Tears filled his eyes.</span>

Serve… Serve… Serve… The word rang loudly in his head. It made him lightheaded. Yugi was no ruler, but he wasn’t a servant, either. He leaned his head against Yami’s shoulder and closed his eyes.

“We’re partners, equals,” he insisted weakly. “I’m so tired, partner, I need to rest.” He had to keep fighting against this. The words were so sweet, so tempting, but it wasn’t right. His partner didn’t truly want this, he had to hold onto that.</span>

He looked up again at Yami. Now he seemed to notice the differences between his dream and reality. It was a dream, it was a dream. Yami wasn’t looking for those memories…

He took a deep breath to steady himself, then another. The flow of tears began to slow. “No memories…” He sighed. “Partner… I’m sorry, partner, I…”

He’d let a dream, his fears, get the best of him. He’d been so close to giving into the Yami in his dreams. He couldn’t look his partner in the eyes.</span>

He held Yugi tighter, even though the pressure would only barely be felt. <em>But, in the end, I do not need them.

But until then, I will make sure I fill in those cracks.</em>

It had to be some self esteem issue- some worry that Yugi was just not good enough for someone who had supposedly been a king. But it didn&#39;t matter to Yami. Yami would give up any crown for Yugi.</span>

Those kinds of words, about his lover, his <em>partner!</em> In a burst of emotion, he shoved Yugi from the front, and took their body. He stumbled from their bed and nearly ran to the bathroom. He looked in the mirror over the sink.

He picked up the brush, and slowly combed out the tangles that had started to form from the nightmare in his hair. And he took his time with it, slowly and carefully. He was meticulous in his work. Once that was done, he leaned into the sink and washed their face, dabbing their face dry. <em>&quot;If you did not deserve me,&quot;</em> He muttered. <em>&quot;Then why would I care for this body?&quot;</em>

He walked back to their room. He carefully adjusted the pillows and blankets, fluffing them up. He laid back down, sighing out a breath. <em>&quot;If you did not deserve me, I would not feel so at home, here. If you did not deserve me, I would not be here.&quot;</em></span>

As Yami laid back down, Yugi sat down at the edge of their bed. He tapped the finger tips of his hands together, glanced over at Yami.

“When you put it like that…” He offered a tentative smile. “I guess I really do deserve you. I’ll try to see myself the way you see me. I love you, and you love me… That should be enough.”

Maybe he should give himself more credit. At least he’d fought back against his nightmare… Even at the end, he didn’t give in. That should count for something, right?</span>

He kissed Yugi&#39;s cheek, then nose. <em>&quot;If you wanted more affection, you only needed to ask, my love.&quot;</em> 

He hummed. And he was so happy to give, too. It made him warm to know that he wanted more affection. He leaned in, and pressed a slow kiss. A few more, not wanting to part for a moment. He wanted Yugi to know he cared for him, that this affection wasn&#39;t a tool to use him for finding some useless memories.</span>

He took his hands, and lifted them up to kiss his knuckles. He had a fleeting thought- Yugi deserved some sort of jewelry, a ring perhaps. Each one was kissed, lingering, trying to keep any further thoughts at bay. <em>&quot;I never want you to think you are not my one and only, partner.&quot;</em></span>

A memory sprang to his mind. His Yami with another Yugi, giving the other Yugi such sweet affection and words. Casting him aside.

He knew Yami hadn’t been in his right mind when it happened. But—

He looked away, downwards. It wasn’t Yami’s fault, he knew that. Maybe if he weren’t so pathetic, it wouldn’t bother him. 

“Your one and only…” he muttered. He didn’t deserve that. He wasn’t good enough for that.</span>

“I’m not good enough to be your one and only. Maybe if I was the other Yugi…” It slipped out. Yami deserved better than this. He closed his eyes. “No, it’s thoughts like that that make me not good enough for you.”

How could he compare to someone so loving and devoted when this pain was taking such a hold of him? When he was afraid of being abandoned by the one who loved him so?</span>

He wasn&#39;t thinking much more than how much he needed to prove to his partner he loved only him. He leaned down and kissed him. Every so often, he parted to mumble, <em>&quot;I am the lucky one, Yugi,&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;You are mine, and I am yours, partner-&quot;</em> 

How else could he explain it? His emotions were an unnameable thing, his words failing him. He kept kissing, making both of them lightheaded from the lack of air. 

<em>&quot;...D-Do you understand, now?&quot;</em> Yami asked, parting to catch his breath. <em>&quot;Your fears...I want to soothe them. You are wonderful for me, you are so good for me. If I were to cast you away for your worry, I would be a fool.&quot;</em>

He ended up half laying on top of Yugi. <em>&quot;Other Yugi...&quot;</em> He made a face. <em>&quot;Never. He may look like you, but he is not you. You are <strong>my</strong> partner.&quot;</em> He pressed the word- maybe a little possessive of him, but, he needed him to know. Needed to know his love for him.</span>

His partner wanted him, and only him. 

“I understand…” He leaned up and kissed his partner on the cheek. “I don’t have to be perfect to be yours. As long as we have each other, that’s all that matters…”

He hummed happily. “I’m your partner, I’m your one and only. Nothing would make me happier…You’re my one and only, too.”

The fears were probably not gone completely, Yugi knew that. They would come back. But right now, he felt so wanted, desired. Yami was here with <em>him</em>.  <em>He</em> was Yami’s partner.</span>
