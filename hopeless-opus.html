But the lack of eyes did not stem his crying- he was so lost without Blues, without anyone to share with these terrible things that had just occoured. And with the officials not believing him...Things felt as if they were getting worse and worse. 
And as soon as Pen let him <em>try</em> to get into Enzan&#39;s room, they got worse. And worse. And ever so worse.
What a mess he could make out. Lines drew across his kaleidoscope vision, explosions of phosphorus green and dark shades of black. The sounds of Enzan&#39;s very measured, controlled breathing filled his receptors. He did not sense Blues here. 
His heart ached at the thought of missing him, because Rock knew Blues was not missing him.
&quot;Enzan?&quot; His voice was thin, still a little scratchy. It hurt to speak, both raw from crying off and on so much and from...The bad event.</span>

Enzan jumped at the sound of any voice that wasn&#39;t Pen&#39;s muffled murmurs. His carefully assembled homeostasis was broken. Breathing broke off into gasps meant to breath out all the demons invading his body. He didn&#39;t recognize the voice, until he saw the speaker. 

&quot;Rockman.&quot; He cleared his throat, recalling a time when he was composed in front of Rockman. A role model. Enzan&#39;s hands were shaking. His whole body was shaking and he was covered in cold sweat. &quot;Rockman. You&#39;re here too.&quot;</span>

Enzan wasn&#39;t positive this Rockman was even real yet. Maybe it didn&#39;t matter until he was out of this withdrawl delirium. He was aware of himself and his condition, but from an outside perspective.</span>

Enzan shivered, and curled into himself. His mind was too constrained to care much about how he was seen. 

&quot;She must&#39;ve told you...&quot; he could see the streams of data under Rock&#39;s eyes. The coding that made him up was raw.</span>

&quot;E-Eyes are im-important. S-Something special, it-it-it&#39;s why h-he...&quot; <em>Took them from me. Knew he couldn&#39;t replicate.</em>

Rockman felt his chest twist. The swing of emotions came back to his sorrow. He just wanted to <em>help.</em> Just like he had wanted back then, but...
Flashbacks played over his broken vision. He forced them away. &quot;I-I&#39;m fine. Thank you.&quot; 
Placing his words quiet, but careful, he simply sat on the ground where he was standing. It was close enough to the exit point if he needed. No where near Blues. 
He did need recovery. But it wasn&#39;t a recovery his father could offer. He almost countered, <em>your diagnostics say you&#39;re gone and never coming back, and I miss you.</em> 
But he felt that wasn&#39;t fair of him.</span>

&quot;Understood.&quot; Then, he returned to his work. He was covering for Enzan as much as possible, keeping intensive work at bay and completing whatever was possible that didn&#39;t need Enzan&#39;s sign off.

The anger. He remembered it as his last cataloged emotion, and he reached another uptick in sobs. He had let the monster <em>live!</em> And now no one believed them and <em>he</em>, Blues, the failed protector, was the enemy! He supposed it was only fitting. A punishment for being too late. For not seeing things more clearly. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t-- I didn&#39;t kill him. I should have. Rockman-- I was selfish. I wanted to stay with Enzan. He doesn&#39;t want me. He&#39;s-- he&#39;s-- he--&quot;</span>

The laugher drove a shudder and choke through him. It was directly Rockman&#39;s <em>fault</em> Enzan even felt that way. 
&quot;Killing him is n-not the a-answer.&quot; He gently pulled his hands down and held them so gently, so softly. &quot;N-Never was, n-never w-will be. N-No matter what.&quot;
No matter what. Rockman hoped he could hold that to be true.

The young man curled into himself. He pulled his legs up onto the bed and hugged them to his chest. 

Blues felt that, and reached through Rockman as a soul-bridge. So long ago, they had done the opposite. It was Blues&#39; turn to return the favor. 

Enzan&#39;s eyes widened, glowing blue as he felt the navis resonate near him. Rockman was accepted, trusted, right away. 

It had been so long since Enzan had felt that red warmth. He&#39;d been scared he&#39;d never feel home again. Blues and Enzan synched to near perfection, exactly into their rightful places. Enzan felt their joint tears fill his eyes. He pulled the blankets over himself.</span>

How long had he given up everything so that Enzan may sleep, may reserve the last bit of life in him so that they could wait for rescue?
He did not watch the two souls join; this time his blindness was chosen and back turned, he worked to take what he could from Enzan&#39;s soul. Fear, that drug, that twisted reality Regal tried to force him into. 
<em>Come home,</em> he whispered- something he had said before. It was mantra. He quietly cleaned that soul, taking on what he could for himself- he could bear it. Enzan did not have to take this weight any longer. Rockman would not let him.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan breathed more normally, allowing the natural shakes and sobs to come forward. Blues cried with him. They finally, together, could find the strength to mourn. 

But, Enzan did not let go of his trauma. There was nothing relingushed to Rockman other than jumbled memories. The emotions would not dislodge themselves-- they were held between Enzan and Blues&#39; souls. Rockman pulled away sludge like memories of voices and frightening images. Enzan&#39;s concepts of the fictitious events Regal had planted grew vague, and he was left with the cold reality of his throat being cut, the imposter Blues, the escape attempt...

Blues felt it all too. He felt the emotions and shifting memories, and he nearly pushed Rockman out of the cross for it. He was taking too much on his small shoulders. Blues tried to help. He needed to know as much as the others did. 

Enzan&#39;s breathing slowed as the two navis sorted through his thoughts. His glowing eyes closed. The cross weakened simply by Enzan&#39;s drifting consciousness.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Rockman stepped back, and said softly, <em>time to rest.</em>
He had taken on what he could- all of the muck had mostly cleared, and he hoped this would bid Enzan sweeter dreams. Rockman himself had started to daydream of the N1, for whatever reason- perhaps, he hoped, Enzan could have a nice dream like that. Of their halcyon days gone by.
Rock&#39;s soul found Blues&#39; and remained close. He would not force anyone to go, not until they were ready. But he could feel Enzan&#39;s drowsiness- it had grown familiar, now. But at least this felt warmer than the collapse.</span>

&quot;I&#39;ve got it,&quot; he nodded. &quot;Done it before. M&#39;fine. Just,&quot; he sighed, &quot;stay around.&quot;
He was happy to do it. Always. It was what he was good for at this point, he felt.</span>

&quot;Of course I will stay. We can remain like this as long as you need.&quot; Blues whispered into Rockman&#39;s hearing receptor. He placed the lightest of kisses to Rock&#39;s head.

&quot;Allow me, next time. Please do not burden yourself more. You brought me back... thank you. I can do more, being fully here. By your side.&quot;</span>

Mm. That was a weird thought. He brushed it away, and tried to relax. &quot;Love ya,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Don&#39;t forget it.&quot;
