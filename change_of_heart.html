“It is like that, yeah… I do really like the kisses… But I also like the praise, and making you guys happy, and…”

How was he supposed to just ask?? It was so simple for his partner to say, but Yugi was pretty sure it would be easier for him to die on the spot than it was to ask.

He peeked between his fingers at Yami and Atem. 

Maybe…if his partner thought he could do it, then maybe…

“Can I…” Yugi forced himself to breathe. “Can I ask you for a favor, Atem?”</span>

He shifted to sit behind Yugi on the bed, the wisp of a kiss pressed to his cheek, then to the back of his neck. <em>Be honest, partner.</em> He murmured, his voice very quiet. 

<strong>Ah. If Yami is allowing me this, then, it must be serious.</strong> He stood there a bit stiff, awkwardly. He was still learning how to come into his own. <strong>You can ask anything of me, Yugi. What do you need?</strong></span>

“I, um…” It was so hard to get the words out. “Do you… Do you remember when we lost the puzzle…and we got it back…and you…you influenced my emotions…to try to protect us?”

It was so hard to continue looking at Atem. He needed to force the words out and just put it out there. Atem would either say yes or no, and it would be fine.

“Can you…”

He really felt like he was going to explode.

“…can you do it again?”</span>

His heart was still beating fast, but now it was full of happiness and love.</span>

Atem took a breath. It was difficult to not give into a rage behind his fingertips, something primal and old inside of him. This was how things were meant to be. People were meant to bow to him. Yugi was <em>meant</em> to make him happy. 

Had to stay focused. Affection. That was better than- that was better than that. He hoped Yugi couldn&#39;t hear those thoughts. Atem held the hand over Yugi&#39;s heart, and tipped his head so they could brush noses. It had become his own way to give affection- it meant a lot to him. <strong>You do not have to do much. You are a perfect prince. You make me happy no matter what, Yugi.</strong>

Atem glanced at Yami again, who had taken a slight glare back at him. That stoked something else inside of Atem- something a bit more playful. Was Yami truly <em>jealous?</em> <strong>However...</strong> He didn&#39;t break eye contact with Yami for a few beats longer. 

<strong>I wouldn&#39;t mind a kiss from you, prince.</strong></span>

“The perfect king deserves a perfect prince. I’d do anything you wanted me to.”

While Atem looked at Yami, Yugi couldn’t take his eyes off Atem. He couldn’t look anywhere else, not with his king present.

And then his king asked for a kiss.

Yugi smiled brightly. “Your wish is my command, my king.” 

He leaned forward and kissed Atem on the lips, soft but firm.</span>

He sighed into the kiss, forgetting even that he was just a spirit in a puzzle and they were just in Yugi&#39;s bedroom. 

His awareness was brought back by a frustrated sigh from Yami. He parted, and couldn&#39;t help a smile. <strong>I think a prince should have his own servant, hm? Of course, handed down by the king.</strong>

Yami blinked. Oh no. He wasn&#39;t-? <em>Atem,</em> he said, though his cheeks had begun to glow pink. <em>I am perfectly content to-</em>

<strong>You should convince him, prince.</strong></span>

Anything his king asked of him. He’d do anything.

“It’s okay.” He brought a hand up to cup Yami’s cheek. “It’s okay to surrender to the king’s desires. There’s no need to feel left out, partner. It feels so good to do what he wants.”

He leaned over and kissed Yami on the forehead. “You could be the perfect servant. I know you could, you’re the one he picked. It’s okay to surrender. It feels so good to surrender.”</span>

And the attention was. Nice. Yugi had never acted like this before...He thought briefly of the way Yugi was in his dreams- he was so angry with him, saying terrible things...

But here, he was being so nice. He felt his own heart race in time with Yugi&#39;s. No! No, had to stay focused. This was between Atem and Yugi- he was just an observer. <em>I-It&#39;s alright, partner. I- I&#39;m happy to just watch over you.</em>

But Atem couldn&#39;t help but laugh, softly. <strong>You&#39;ll convince him.</strong> Yami glared at him again, clearly embarrassed and terribly conflicted.</span>

“You could be so much happier. You don’t have to be afraid or worried. You can join us, the king himself invited you. You can submit yourself to the king, too. You could be just as happy as I am. You deserve to be happy.”

He leaned forward and kissed Yami briefly on the lips.

He blinked. A soft red tint came to his eyes, too. He had a fleeting thought that Atem, surely, was never going to let him live this down. But it got drowned out looking down at his partner. <em>I...If it...makes you happy.</em> He murmured, softly. Like how Yugi only had eyes on Atem, Yami found himself only paying attention to Yugi. This was fine, right? He had enough of a mind to help it if something started to go amiss. 

But they were warm. He didn&#39;t see anything alarming. Atem just wanted to mess with him- or, maybe...? Make him happy? <strong>Now you&#39;re catching on,</strong> he smiled. 

Atem reached out, and touched Yugi&#39;s hair, petting it back slowly. <strong>Good work. I knew you would do well, prince.</strong></span>

...He suddenly had a much better understanding of Yugi&#39;s angry outburst, before.

Atem smiled, too. He felt very happy about the two of them, looking so content. If this could be used for this- that was good. That was what he wanted more than anything else. Anything...He had to be responsible, with Yugi like this. He knew the effects of what would happen if his emotions got the better of him. But that was the role of a king, right? He had to be responsible, take care of those below him...and in return, he would get loyalty. And in this case, love.

“Of course I’m right,” Yugi soothed Yami. “The perfect prince has to be, for the ones he loves.”

He closed his eyes again as Atem kept petting his hair. It felt so nice…

“I’m happy and comfortable. I feel great, my king.” He smiled. “I couldn’t ask for a better king… All I want is your affection. I couldn’t ask for anything more than that, nothing makes me happier…”

He hummed, happily. He was so lucky, to have the perfect king and the perfect servant, to have love from both of them.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yami wasn&#39;t used to this. More his speed was having control over every situation- he always had more confidence than Yugi, filling out what he didn&#39;t have. But in this moment, he felt...smaller. More vulnerable. It was...weird. 

He hadn&#39;t decided if he liked it yet, or not. There was still clear conflict across his features. So Atem reached out and tapped his head. <strong>Relax.</strong>

Yami found himself listening before he caught up to what was said. He did relax, just like Yugi did. He couldn&#39;t find himself overthinking the situation anymore. He shuffled so he and Atem basically sandwiched Yugi between them. And there was that look in Atem&#39;s eye, again- this was so different than his usual. He seemed so at home, comfortable, confident like this. Like tapping into muscle memory he thought he had forgotten. The only difference was he wasn&#39;t targeting it into anger. 

He wondered if it would overwhelm Yugi and wake him from whatever spell he had, but- he was very cute like this, and he asked very nicely! So Atem leaned and kissed Yugi&#39;s head. <strong>Servant,</strong> he addressed quietly. Yami knew fleetingly he would kick himself for having lifted his head in response, but he couldn&#39;t manage to make himself feel it in the moment. <strong>I think he asked very kindly. Why don&#39;t you offer your affection, too.</strong>

Yami nodded- that was simple. He always wanted to give Yugi his affection. It wasn&#39;t about following some...order. Right. He leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to Yugi&#39;s lips, brief but sweet. He hasn&#39;t noticed Atem was making him more solid now- he&#39;d devoted what power he had to the other...How nice of him. 

Atem tapped his side, and Yami seemed to know what that meant- he parted from Yugi to allow Atem a turn, kissing him just the same. He was a bit more firm, but was otherwise just as kind. And they traded him back and forth, giving him kisses along the way. <strong>Does this affection suit you, prince?</strong></span>

The consecutive kiss alternating between the two of them surprised Yugi. Not in a bad way, of course, it was an extremely good surprise. He tried to kiss them both back each time, but it was difficult to keep up. He was panting for breath by the time Atem asked the question. His cheeks had turned pink.

“This is perfect… This is better than… Than I could ever ask for… Thank you… My king… My servant…”

It was close to overwhelming him, but at the same time, there was no such thing as too much affection. This really was perfect. His king and his servant were so kind, so perfect…</span>

And Yami was very competitive. If Atem had given him some of his ability, maybe he could use it to his own advantage. He whispered in Yugi&#39;s ear, <em>Perhaps the king would like affection like this too, prince. You and I should make him happy, hm? That is our...role, after all.</em>

Now it was Atem&#39;s turn to look a little flushed, shooting a mild glare at Yami, whom smiled back at him. He would have made it into a smirk, but, he found himself only able to do a dopey smile. <strong>I&#39;m not sure the servant should order a prince around.</strong>

<em>Just a suggestion, is all. I want to make the king happy, too.</em></span>

“My servant has a point… We should make the king happy.”

Yugi didn’t mind being ordered around by a servant. In fact, he was more than happy to take Yami’s orders and suggestions. It made him just as happy as taking Atem’s orders.

“You should get affection, too, my king… You should be happy… It’s what I’m here for, after all. I’d do anything to make you happy…”

Yugi leaned forward and kissed Atem softly on the lips.</span>

Atem immediately became flustered, and the darker red from his eyes faded. Yami too felt himself &quot;wake up&quot; in a sense, and he couldn&#39;t help but laugh quietly. He had won this one, still. Good. 

<em>1-0, Atem.</em> He grinned, and Atem glared at him when he and Yugi parted. Though his attention didn&#39;t last long on Yami- was Yugi alright? Waking up abruptly...

<strong>A-Are you okay, Yugi?</strong> Yeah, his cool was definitely a bit gone now- back to slightly awkward but terribly cute Atem.</span>

Once his brain caught up with everything that had happened, his face turned bright red. He stared down at the floor, unable to meet Yami’s nor Atem’s eyes. 

He’d told Yami to <em>surrender to the king</em>, he called Yami his <em>servant</em>. He’d called himself <em>perfect</em>. He’d said so many embarrassing things.

Yugi hid his face in his hands. “I’m fine—“ he managed. “I— I— Did I really—“

He wasn’t sure how to finish the statement. He wasn’t sure how to continue. It might’ve been easier to explode than to—

Yeah, he’d enjoyed the experience, he’d really enjoyed the experience. He was just so embarrassed! He couldn’t believe the way he’d been talking. And it was embarrassing just how much he enjoyed the whole thing. He just—

Yugi let out a squeak. He might not be able to show his face to Yami or Atem ever again.</span>

He was very lucky.

Atem fidgeted with his hands, worried he had done something wrong. Yugi looked- almost pained? <strong>I hope I did not scare you,</strong> he said softly, and he mimicked the way Yugi would tap his fingers together. <strong>N-Not my intention.</strong></span>

<em>And you both seemed happy. That is what matters, hm?</em> He nodded. <em>You know, it may prove useful in some way. Even if we have only seen it in...dangerous circumstance...You listened to him well. More than well, even...</em> 

Yami looked thoughtful for a moment. Atem looked at him with a tilted head. <strong>Perhaps in times of duress, I could use this to calm, and focus him.</strong> Yami looked at him, and laughed. 

<em>Oh, hm, sure. I was thinking on a smaller level.</em> He leaned over, and whispered in Atem&#39;s ear. Atem blinked, and then nodded. Atem looked down at Yugi, taking his cheek again.

Yugi stared up at Atem, his eyes once again taking on a red tint. He smiled. &quot;Of course. I&#39;d be happy to, my king. Anything to make you happy.&quot;

All the embarrassment he&#39;d just been feeling was gone. He was calm, happy. He got up from the bed and walked to his desk. There he had a math textbook and math tests waiting for him to review; he sat down and pulled open the math textbook to a specific chapter.

He was unable to be distracted from his task, his focus unwavering. The red in his eyes glowed as he read each paragraph carefully. There was a smile on his face the entire time.

Anything to make his king happy.</span>

Ough. Now he was thinking like that. <em>I told you, it would have smaller benefits. Now he can enjoy studying.</em> Atem nodded slowly, watching Yugi work. He did seem so dedicated to the task, and he was smiling...

<strong>Yami,</strong> Atem spoke soft enough that Yugi wouldn&#39;t be able to hear him- almost just thinking the words. <strong>When I am like this, there is...I feel there is something inside of me. There&#39;s this- an-anger. I do not want to harm him. He is so happy, here...</strong>

<em>You will not.</em> Yami said it simply. He was watching Yugi work. <em>We are past that. We will learn from our past mistakes...and your muscles will learn new memories, with us.</em>

Yami smiled at him. <em>Enjoy what we have. You worry so much...King.</em> He teased, getting up and walking over to Yugi. He pressed a kiss to his head. <em>You&#39;re working very hard. Will you tell me what you&#39;re working on?</em> It was a test to see if Yugi was still distractible. Atem watched from the bed, still, finding himself following Yami&#39;s lead this time.</span>

&quot;Hmm?&quot; He blinked as Yami kissed his head. &quot;What I&#39;m working on?&quot; He didn&#39;t even look up from his book. &quot;That&#39;s only for the king to know.&quot;

Without another word, he went back to his reading.</span>

Yami raised a hand, signaling to him to not worry. As far as he was concerned, this was a positive outcome. Yugi was only saying that because he wanted to be good...He could admire that. <em>I suppose I&#39;ll leave you to it, then.</em> 

Yami returned back to Atem&#39;s side. <em>He is very enamored with math at the moment. That is his least favorite, you know.</em> 

<strong>I see,</strong> Atem murmured. He felt a swell of emotion inside of him. Yugi was so loyal like this- and he could feel all of that love through the puzzle. He realized, then, that solidified his decision. There could be nothing better in those memories, than this moment. Helping Yugi to succeed, protecting him. There was so much light inside of Yugi- he wanted to help it grow. Yami smiled at him. <em>Now you&#39;re catching on.</em>

Atem rose up, and walked over to Yugi. He draped himself over his shoulders, like Yami had. <strong>Good work, prince.</strong> He said quietly. He kissed the side of his head, and blinked the red from his eyes. He needed Yugi to know he meant this, no matter if he was under influence or not. <strong>...I believe my decision has been solidified. There is no where I would rather be, than with you, Yugi. You have such a special heart- I want to see you grow. I want...to be apart of your life. No matter what. I will use this to protect you.</strong> He buried his face into Yugi&#39;s hair. <strong>Thank you for trusting me. Thank you.</strong>

<em>So serious,</em> Yami murmured. He realized where he got it from. But right now, his heart felt so light- he couldn&#39;t feel all of the stuffiness of usual.</span>

And then his king was here, giving him affection. He looked up, grinning. “Thank you, my king—“

He woke up. Yugi blinked. He was just… He had just been enjoying studying math. <em>Enjoying</em> it.

He listened to Atem’s words. He grinned. “I want you to be part of my life, too, Atem… There’s nowhere I’d rather you be than right here.” He hummed happily, closing his eyes. “I’m glad you’re here… I love you…”

Trusting Atem came so easily. He loved Atem, he’d give Atem as many chances as it took to learn.

“I’m so happy you want to be with me. I want to be with you, too…”</span>

There was still a mild conflict inside him- worries he would abuse this ability, treat them both poorly. But- that was the point of learning, right? Learning to be good, learning to trust not only them, but himself. 

<strong>I love you too,</strong> he said, voice a bit small. There was the inkling of some memory on the edges of his awareness- he knew just how important it was to say words like that. It meant the world. And with his name, too...Every time Yugi said it, it felt just as powerful as it supposedly was. 

<em>You were focused,</em> Yami appeared, leaning on the desk. <em>I even kissed your cheek and you didn&#39;t even react. I see how it is,</em> he teased, though it was clear he didn&#39;t mind. The grin on his face was more than he&#39;d emoted in a good while. Too much going on, too much turmoil that hadn&#39;t been released. But now, here they were. Playful, light. Yugi was happy. What more could he ask for? <em>You were comfortable, hm? Nothing feels amiss?</em></span>

Even if his partner wasn’t upset, Yugi felt bad. He should remedy that, somehow, when he got the chance.

“I-I was comfortable. Happy. I… I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed studying on my own that much…” And he’d retained the information, too. Yugi could still remember every word he read.</span>

Atem found himself tired again. He was still learning how to be around as much as Yami had learned to- he had more practice. He yawned quietly, looking up at Yami. He nodded to him, and Atem kissed Yugi&#39;s head again before fading back into the puzzle. 

He took the opportunity, then, to slide in where Atem was. <em>...You were safe, correct? I trust him...And I want you safe above all else. You spoke very differently. Not- not in a...bad way. Just different. F...Focused on him, especially.</em>

There was his worry, coming back to him, slowly. He realized then he was doing what he did to everyone when he wasn&#39;t alone with Yugi, then- putting on a show. Acting more confident than he really felt. He felt a sting of embarrassment about it- Atem was trusted, right-? But maybe it was something he couldn&#39;t help.

He didn&#39;t realize how much he needed to hear that- when the false confidence faded away, he was left feeling somewhat insecure. Atem did- <em>could</em> offer things that Yami couldn&#39;t. Not in the same ways, anyhow. And he loved Atem too, but it was almost like his love was an extension of Yugi&#39;s. He and Atem were a different case. 

Yami and Yugi were the same person, but he and Atem...He and Atem were <em>once</em> the same person. He was still learning how to divorce himself from the idea. <em>He</em> wasn&#39;t the king. Atem was. Always had been. 

<em>...Thank you, partner.</em> He said softly. <em>I suppose I was worried of that. I am learning to be...vulnerable around Atem. I&#39;m sure you could...tell.</em> He glanced at the math homework open on the desk. It was gibberish to him. <em>I love you, too. Atem has changed nothing of my feelings for you. You are my beloved.</em>

He felt the urge to wave off the emotions again. He gestured. <em>Besides. I was still aware enough. I was only playing along being your &#39;servant&#39;, surely.</em> He laughed out his own embarrassment. Yeah, that was totally the truth.</span>

He giggled. “Just playing along? Well, I appreciate that you played along, then. It was…” It was really nice, receiving affection from both Atem and Yami at the same time. “…I enjoyed it.”

Yami had still been aware enough? Well, Yugi could remember everything he did and said, but he’d immediately and willingly surrendered himself completely. If Yami had kept some control, that was only more proof of how strong he was.</span>

He shivered from the sensation of the kiss. “I guess…it can’t be too bad of a thing to want to be confident. I’m…I’m still working on being confident. I’m not sure I’m all that powerful, though…”

To him, Atem and Yami were the powerful ones. He was just Yugi.</span>

Yami smirked. He glanced at Yugi, who he knew would be on board. <em>&quot;Alright. Then we should do something to strengthen teamwork. Perhaps a game against each other.&quot;</em>

He was so thankful), and looked around what Yugi had in here. It would reflect whatever Yugi had been thinking of, and...

He smirked. Yugi was never subtle. He picked up a board game he knew he&#39;d been eyeing in the store on and off- some logic game. &quot;Mastermind&quot;. Cute. 

He came back over. True to form, the game was completely white. Which was a bit difficult, since the game seemed to require colors. <em>&quot;I think this will work. A logic game between us.&quot;</em>

Yami closed his eyes, and when he opened them, they were in a room of his own design. It was simplistic- a table between them. Atem and Yugi at one side, and Yami at the other. He adjusted the game so it would work appropriately for them. <em>&quot;The goal is to guess the position and color of each peg by the end of the game. Each time we make a guess, we will be told if we have the correct color, location, or both.&quot;</em>

He waved his hand, and the game seemed to set itself up. He was confident. This was his element, even if Shadow Games were given to him by Atem. 

<em>&quot;If you are ready.&quot;</em> He directed it to Atem. Atem nodded, and then tipped Yugi&#39;s cheek. Here, inside of their minds, Atem&#39;s eyes were even more alluring. <strong>Are you ready, prince?</strong></span>

…Speaking of. Once he looked at Atem’s eyes, Yugi felt like he couldn’t look away. His eyes took on a red tint as he once again surrendered completely and willingly to the king.

“I’m ready, my king. Whenever you are. We’ll win this game together.”</span>

His expression hardened, slightly. Just as it always did during a shadow game, his eyes glowed a mix of purple and red, alongside a golden third eye.

<em>&quot;Then we will have stakes higher. A proper Shadow Game between us.&quot;</em>

Yami had control over that part. And that&#39;s what he wanted, needed. Control. <em>&quot;You&#39;ll play for your king&#39;s sake. Lose, and he will receive the penalty game in your stead.&quot;</em> 

Atem didn&#39;t seem concerned. He kissed Yugi&#39;s cheek. <strong>You&#39;ll do fine. My perfect prince never fails to make me happy.&quot;</strong>

Yami was <em>so</em> lucky they were in their own little bubble, because the grip he had on his own thigh right now could probably bruise. Equal parts latent rage and embarrassment were running through him. He was already forgetting an important rule- emotions. Had to keep them in check. 

<em>&quot;Game start. The King and his Prince will begin.&quot;</em></span>

If he was playing for the king, then losing wasn’t an option. He couldn’t allow his king to suffer a penalty game. Especially not because of him. He had to be perfect for the king.

Yugi took stock of the game situation. Six colors to pick from, four slots for each answer. He could do this easily, he was sure. 

He made his first guess. Pink, white, green, blue. As soon as his guess was made, his eyes were on his king again. Between the excitement of the game and his love for Atem, his heart was racing.</span>

He couldn&#39;t help a slight glare at Atem. That attention...He breathed in, out, and reached to make his own guess. It was early enough that he any guess was fair game. Red, blue, pink, yellow.

Three correct colors. One in the right spot. 

Though he also found himself looking at Atem when he had made his guess. Less with adoration and more with a sense of competition. Like Yugi was only his proxy. 

Rule number two was to not get distracted. 

And he was immensely distracted. 

Atem turned and whispered in his ear, low so Yami couldn&#39;t hear, <strong>He looks distracted. Perhaps if you keep distracting him, he&#39;ll make a mistake. You want to win, hm?</strong>

He pressed a kiss to his cheek with a smile. He winked at Yami, which only made him a bit more frustrated at him.</span>

First things first, Yugi needed to make his own guess. He considered his options. In the first guess, two colors had been correct, in the second guess, three. One of the colors in the right spot for the second guess. He considered which colors were in both guesses, which were only in one or the other…

And made his guess. Blue, red, pink, green.

His attention was completely on Atem once more. He wrapped his arms around Atem’s shoulders. “Am I playing well, my king? I have to be the perfect prince for you, after all. You deserve nothing less.” He leaned up and kissed Atem on the cheek, then on the nose.

If he kept his attention and adoration on his king, then Yami would get jealous and be distracted, right? He wanted to distract Yami as much as possible, so he could win for his king. He had to win.</span>

Yami, however, in this moment, has forgotten his rules. All he can see is the damn red in Atem&#39;s eyes, and the way Yugi looked at him with all of that love and- ugh.

He barely payed attention to what Yugi played. <strong>Of course, prince. You always play so well. I&#39;m always impressed by the Prince of Games, after all.</strong>

Red, yellow, blue, pink. That&#39;d be fine. He played the combination, and looked away. Three colors. One in the right place. No progress.

He looked over his new information. Based on Yami’s guesses, he knew one of the colors for sure. The rest was still just guesses. He thought he knew what one of the color’s locations was, but looking back…

Red, pink, white, green.

There were three colors right, and three in the right spot…

He needed to keep distracting Yami in order to make sure he won. They were so close to the answer, now.  Not that he needed an excuse to show his affection for the king.

He leaned his forehead against Atem’s. “Nothing makes me happier than impressing you, my king… Everything I do is for your approval, your happiness.”

He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Atem’s lips. “I love you, my king…”</span>

Right. 

He looked down at the board, taking a few long beats to think over the last couple of moves. <em>I love you, my king.</em> He didn&#39;t want to admit how bad that was bothering him. Maybe he <em>did</em> want to keep being called king, even if it was never true, and <em>he</em> wanted Yugi to be <em>his-</em>

Ugh! Right, the colors- Red, pink, green, yellow. 

He frowned. All four colors were correct, but two were in the wrong place. 

Atem&#39;s eyes flickered to the board, then back to Yugi. He knew the answer already, but, he was trying to allow his prince to solve it. He knew how happy it would make him to serve him, to get the answer correct. <strong>Go on, prince. Last guess.</strong> He whispered, <strong>You want to make the king happy.

Hm. As the light faded out from his eyes, and he ended the Shadow Game, he realized something that had him feeling...a way. 

Yugi was very eager to win- and that had been the point of all this. But if this had been a true shadow game...That would have meant Yami received a penalty game. And Yugi didn&#39;t seem overly concerned about it. He shook his head to himself. <em>No,</em> he thought, <em>he just knows this isn&#39;t a real game. That&#39;s all. Atem and Yugi wouldn&#39;t have agreed...</em>

Atem smiled at Yugi, giving him affection- a kiss on each cheek, and then on his nose. <strong>Good work, prince. You&#39;ve made me very happy.</strong>

Hm. 

He smiled at the two of them. <em>&quot;Well done. It looks like you two work well together. And I have my work to do on logic games.&quot;</em> He reached over and picked up the pieces of the game, and they turned back to white under his touch. <em>&quot;This will be good, if we so need it. You were more focused than I have gotten you before...Yugi.&quot;</em>

He realized he probably wasn&#39;t being listened to. He glanced to Atem, who realized it as well, and blinked the red from his eyes. He looked back to Yugi, a bit more sheepish. <strong>Y-You and I won, it looks like.</strong></span>

&quot;We did...we did!&quot; He kissed Atem very quickly on the cheek. &quot;I guess we make a good team...&quot; He laughed, awkwardly. &quot;Hold on a second.&quot;

He&#39;d been affectionate during the game, <em>very</em> affectionate, and it was only partially for the sake of distracting Yami. But all that affection had all gone towards Atem, while Yami...

Yugi raced around the table towards Yami. &quot;Partner! Partner, are you okay?&quot; He leaned up to kiss Yami on the cheek. &quot;I know we were just practicing a game, but I was working so hard to distract you, and that must have been so hard for you...&quot;

He leaned up to kiss Yami on the forehead. &quot;I love you, partner...&quot;</span>

He didn&#39;t realize how much he needed that contact- was maintaining a shadow game always this hard? When Yugi touched him, it felt like his body was suddenly made of lead. <em>&quot;I-I love you too, partner. You- You won, look. You did so well. I am so proud of you.&quot;</em>

And he was! He was. That was 100% true. Oh, hell. He didn&#39;t want to get emotional around Atem, but-

He pulled Yugi closer and dipped his face into his shoulder, staying still for a while. Yugi must have been able to tell he was distracted, terribly so. The affection hit him like a truck, and his shoulders shook and- oh. He was crying. Why was he-?

<em>&quot;S-Sorry,&quot;</em> he mumbled. <em>&quot;I-I suppose it took more out of me to. M-Maintain that game, than I thought.&quot;</em> That must have been it.</span>

He frowned. Had Yami ever been this exhausted after a game before? Maybe it was different, now, with Atem playing with them as well. Maybe it was different now that they knew Yami and Atem were separate.

Yugi ran a hand through Yami’s hair. He wrapped hus free arm around Yami’s shoulders. He hoped this affection was helping.

“There’s nothing to apologize for. We can rest if you need to, if there’s anything you need…”

He pressed a kiss to the top of Yami’s head. “Just tell me, partner. I’m here for you.”

During the game, Atem was all he could think about. Now, all of his attention was on Yami. He’d do whatever it  took to help his partner and make him happy.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Atem folded his arms. He could tell exactly what was upsetting Yami in that moment. He debated whether or not he should step in, wondering if he should afford the two of them time together, or...

He sighed. He knew that Yami wasn&#39;t <em>truly</em> mad at him, or fully in control of what he was feeling. He knew they were alike in that way- still learning how their emotions worked, what was behind them. They were both still becoming. It made sense to want affection from the one they both loved. 

But all this conflict? He didn&#39;t need that. Even when Yugi was under whatever this was, Atem could feel the love that was core to him for Yami. They were a part of each other, Atem there or not. But if he knew something of his own shadow, was that he wasn&#39;t going to tell the truth. But now he knew he could change that. He approached the two of them, and tapped Yami&#39;s shoulder. Yami looked up at him, already trying to sputter out some kind of excuse-

Atem gently cupped his cheeks, and looked at Yami pointedly. In his surprise, he couldn&#39;t get himself to fight against it. <strong>&quot;Would you be kind, and tell Yugi what you&#39;d like from him?&quot;</strong> 

With soft red in his eyes, Yami looked up at Yugi, mumbling simply, <em>&quot;Want your attention. Jealous, earlier. Thought you&#39;d be...fine if I got a penalty game. Made me worried. Sorry.&quot;</em>

Atem made sure to not catch eyes with Yugi, so he could stay aware with Yami. He wanted to make sure focus was on him.</span>

But Atem just wanted to help, it looked like. That was good. Yugi appreciated that.

“You don’t have to be sorry, partner. I’m the one who should apologize, I got really caught up in the moment… But I wouldn’t have been fine if you got a penalty game. I hate to see you in pain, it would’ve hurt me so badly to see you get one. I just… I didn’t think you’d get one. We’ve practiced games before where you didn’t get one, so I wasn’t really…thinking.”

He smiled. “If you need my attention, I can give you that. I <em>want</em> to give you my attention. All you have to do is ask, and it’s yours.”

He leaned forward and kissed Yami on the nose, before kissing him on the lips. He’d showed such adoration and love towards Atem earlier, it was only fair Yami received the same.</span>

Oh no. He <em>wanted</em> to stop talking, but Atem had given him an order, and like this he felt compelled to carry it out to the end. <em>&quot;I- I am not- I do not want things to change from where they are, and- I-&quot;</em>

He was trying to resist it again. Atem looked down at him, and he mumbled out, <em>&quot;I miss when you called me king, too-&quot;</em>

And then he covered his face, embarrassed by his own feelings. How much he and Yugi were the same, Atem thought.</span>

How much were the achievements he and Yugi shared actually belong to him? Where did Atem end and he begin? He rubbed his eyes and made himself look at Yugi. How pathetic he must look, he thought bitterly. He was supposed to fill out the things Yugi couldn&#39;t be, and here he was, emotional and weak after a stupid game. 

Atem looked at him again, another pointed look. The two of them seemed to be able to communicate in a wordless way. That happened when you were convinced you were the same for so long. Atem waved a hand, and they were in a different room. One they had never been in before...

It appeared to be something of Atem&#39;s lost memories. Something he had tried to cobble together from what he knew and what came to him, what his soul knew more than his mind. It was a large room, the bed shoved to one wall. It had a canopy, which held a thin, golden mesh around the bedframe. There were only some parts of the room fully rendered- glyphs lined parts of the walls, like the inside of the puzzle, but they didn&#39;t seem correct. Angled oddly, or too big or too small. And there were aspects of Yugi&#39;s room here, too- a nightstand, with a place where Yugi always set the puzzle every night to sleep. Normal windows against stone walls. It was...weird. But Atem had made it, and he had brought them here...He must have trusted them very much.</span>

Outside was an empty, fast plane that just held stars upon stars. He was letting the two of them have their time together- now, hopefully, more comfortably. 

<em>&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, partner. I&#39;ve always trusted you, I still do. I shouldn&#39;t let these- these pointless emotions get in the way.&quot;</em> It was a clear deflection of what he really meant, wanted. He wanted Yugi&#39;s assurance and comfort. But that wasn&#39;t his <em>role.</em> It should be the other way around. He felt Atem&#39;s gaze on him again, and his heart compelled him before his mind could stop him- 

<em>&quot;S-Since we have connected with Atem, I have felt. Lost. I do not know-&quot;</em> He shook his head. He wanted to resist saying it, but his mouth started moving again. <em>&quot;I do not know where I end and he begins. What if I have never been your partner? What if it was always him? I- I don&#39;t want that to be true. I want to be yours. I want you to be mine. B-But watching you with him, you- you won against me. You were so focused, and...&quot;</em>

He sniffed, rubbing tears from his eyes again. <em>&quot;I don&#39;t want it to be true that I do not belong, and he is the one who is supposed to be in your heart. I want it to be both of us.&quot;</em></span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yugi blinked when the space shifted, and he suddenly found himself on a bed. It surprised him, but it was comfortable, and he certainly wasn’t going to complain. He wanted to take a look at the room around him, but his desire to help Yami was stronger than his curiosity. He didn’t look away from his partner.

“Your emotions aren’t pointless. Emotions are a good thing to have, even if we don’t always like them. It’s valid that you feel this way.”

Yugi swallowed back some guilt. He had been so eager to work with Atem and be under his control that he’d clearly neglected Yami’s feelings about the situation. He needed to do better in the future, make sure his partner knew just how much he loved him.

“I can’t say where you end and Atem begins, because I don’t know. But we’ll figure it out together, because I won’t leave your side. I won’t let you go through this alone, partner.”

He smiled. “You <em>are</em> my partner. I know you are.” He leaned forward to kiss Yami’s cheek. “Atem doesn’t know how to duel. Which means <em>we</em> got through Duelist Kingdom together, you and me. You belong in my heart because I <em>want</em> you there, partner. I always will want you there. I want you to be mine, and I want to be yours. You <em>are</em> my partner. I want you to be my partner.” He kissed Yami’s other cheek. “If I want to be your partner, and you want to be mine, then we’re partners. I won’t accept not being your partner.”</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The bed was especially nice. Way, <em>way</em> nicer than Yugi&#39;s. Bigger, too, certainly big enough so that the three of them wouldn&#39;t be on top of each other (though, they found Yugi did like it that way). The bigger waves of emotion had finally passed, and Yami felt better after expressing all of that verbally. It made it more real, not just some nebulous thing inside of his head. He wanted to be annoyed at Atem for being right, but he found himself only able to think...well, a bit mushy thoughts about the two of them. Now that all of the crying and negative emotions had gotten out, he was left with whatever warm feeling Atem was lending to him. You could tell the shift had started because when Yugi kissed his cheeks, he looked back at him with a slightly dopey smile. 

<em>&quot;Y-Youre right,&quot;</em> He murmured softly, and leaned his head to rest against Yugi&#39;s shoulder. His body still did feel like lead. <em>&quot;Y-You wouldn&#39;t lie to me. M&#39;prince doesn&#39;t need to lie. Partner, I love you.&quot;</em>

Atem couldn&#39;t help a soft chuckle as he joined the two of them on the bed, still avoiding Yugi&#39;s eyes for the moment. <strong>&quot;He seems better now.&quot;</strong>

Yami nodded, and a small, somewhat uncharacteristic giggle came out of him. He sounded a <em>lot</em> like Yugi then. 

<strong>&quot;1-1, Yami. Tied up.&quot;</strong> Atem smiled, tapping his back. Yami didn&#39;t move, but he laughed again. <strong>&quot;He&#39;s extremely exhausted. I didn&#39;t realize he was maintaining the game field almost entirely on his own. Very impressive. A victory in its own right for him.&quot;</strong>

Atem kept his eyes on the far window, looking at the stars. They were almost unnaturally clear. <strong>&quot;...This is a space I modeled after the one you showed me. Do you like it?&quot;</strong></span>

As Yami leaned his head against Yugi’s shoulder, Yugi leaned down to kiss the top of his head. He wrapped his arms around Yami with a smile.

As Atem joined them on the bed, Yugi nodded. “My partner’s very strong. He has a lot to be proud of. But it makes sense he’s tired out. Practicing shadow games has worn him out other times we’ve practiced, too…”

Now that Yami had calmed down, Yugi took a look around the room. “It’s really nice, I like it. It’s a mix of the old and the new… Kind of like your relationship with us. Your old with our new, letting us fill in the pieces you’re missing.” He nodded. “I like it, Atem. It’s very you.”</span>

He was starting to come into his own, only through their help and guidance. And that was so special. It made him smile, too. 

<strong>&quot;That must be why the stars outside are so bright,&quot;</strong> He hummed, <strong>&quot;You two must have inspired them.&quot;</strong>

Yami squirmed. <em>&quot;T-That is sappy.&quot;</em> 

<strong>&quot;That it is,&quot;</strong> Atem tapped his shoulder again. <strong>&quot;And so are you. it must also explain why it is so cold in here at night, and warm in day...your room is like that, too.&quot;</strong>

Oh, he couldn&#39;t help it. He turned to Yugi and gave him a kiss on his forehead. <strong>&quot;You did well today. Both of you. I couldn&#39;t be happier anywhere else, than with two perfect partners, like you both.&quot;</strong></span>

Perfect partners… Yugi ran a hand through Yami’s hair, a big smile on his facr. “And I couldn’t be happier than I am with my two perfect kings.

He kissed Atem on the cheek, then gave Yami a kiss on the top of his head.</span>
