                    <span class="markdown">The quiet hum of mechanical equipment provided the soundtrack to a room in the intensive care unit. A woman sat on the rolling stool next to the patient’s bed, with an arm outstretched to allow her hand to rest near the other that laid there. It looked as if she hadn’t moved from that spot all day, tired eyes staring at the body that laid there in front of her. 

It was buried in gauze, cords and tubes. She had stopped counting them a long time ago, unable to properly display her grief as the number kept rising. This body couldn’t thrive on it’s own, not in it’s current state. But these tubes and cords were keeping it alive, keeping whatever soul residing within it tethered to earth. At least until it was time to make impossible decisions.

“<em>… Izabella.</em>” The soft metallic voice made the woman lift her head slightly. Her thick, wavy, mint hair jostled slightly in response as she looked to her hand to see a green navi’s hologram standing by it. 

Searchman spoke in Sharonian, foreign to the hospital’s personnel, but not the occupants of the room. “<em>They will be asking us to leave soon, for your own health.</em>”

Izabella looked away from the navi and towards the body once again. She picked her hand up and brought it to it’s head, allowing worn fingers to pass through hair that held the same shade as her own. As she stood, she swallowed a lump in her throat, and leaned in to press a motherly kiss to the body’s temple. 

&quot;I want to visit the girl first.&quot; She stated quietly, in the language shared. &quot;I want to thank her.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Penelope was laying in a hospital bed, alone. She&#39;d been tended to and cared for fully, but now she was ignored in favor of the boys in more imminent danger. It felt like no matter how many days went by, there was still no good news to be had. She couldn&#39;t even get up to visit Enzan and Laika without threatening to bust stitches and aggrivate broken ribs.

Nurses had to remind her multiple times not to move. Only once they allowed her to video chat with Enzan for once did she briefly settle from restless legs. He didn&#39;t talk much, but at least she could see with her own eyes that he was still alive. Laika though, they wouldn&#39;t let her see. 

&quot;Pen, you have a visitor. Ms. Biryukov.&quot; Role spoke softly from the monitor, clearly affectating some of the nurse prog&#39;s behaviors. Pen&#39;s eyes grew wide. She set down the book she had been staring at.

&quot;Really-? Ah, yeah of course she can come in. That&#39;s fine.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Izabella straightened up when the room door slid open. She glanced in with a bit of hesitation. Usually someone else was there to greet her on the other side. The lack of life in this hospital was horrible. 

Though, she quickly took back that thought as she got a first glance of the girl in the bed. Izabella smiled at her, one of Laika&#39;s saviors. She seemed to be doing well.

&quot;Извините за вторжение-&quot; Izabella halted mid-bow, looking crossed. Short and sturdy, she fumbled with her pockets until a dark green PET was produced. &quot;Searchman?&quot;

He appeared on her shoulder after a moment, his expression harder than usual. &quot;<em>&#39;Apologies for the intrusion.&#39;</em>&quot;

Izabella nodded contently, and spoke again from the doorway. This time, Search followed after her, translating her Sharonian.

&quot;<em>&#39;I hope this is a good time.&#39;</em>&quot; his voice was flat, mismatched with her specks of liveliness. &quot;<em>&#39;I wanted to visit before leaving for the night.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

It felt odd obeying Japanese customs when neither were native to here. As much as this was her home, she was still Netopian born and raised. 

&quot;I am happy to have visitors. My family lives in Netopia and can&#39;t easily come here.&quot; She paused to allow Searchman time to translate, but quickly realized she didn&#39;t have to. &quot;Ah, but I didn&#39;t know Laika had a sister! I am so happy to meet you.&quot;</span>

A miasma of the weight that sat on her shoulders. She came close to the bed, and found the stool near it to be a familiar companion.

&quot;H-Huh?&quot; Her eyebrows creased, much like Laika&#39;s would&#39;ve when he heard something ridiculous. And Izabella did think that, though she quickly relaxed and laughed.

&quot;<em>&#39;I appreciate the compliment.&#39;</em>&quot; She stated mid-peal. A second to calm herself, and Izabella took a seat. From this close, her lingering youth took a back seat to crow&#39;s feet and a curl of grey. &quot;<em>&#39;I really do, you are so kind, but...&#39;</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>&#39;I am his mother. Call me Izabella.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

She was relieved that the situation hadn&#39;t been reversed. And, laughing was such a release from the grim silence and whispered voices. 

&quot;Yes ah-- hello Izabella.&quot; Somehow, the fact that this was his mother made Pen&#39;s chest sink more than before. What should she say to a someone in her position? Even though Pen was the one in a hospital bed, she felt the overwhelming urge to care for this woman. &quot;I&#39;m Penelope, as you already know ahah... uhm... where are you staying in the city? If you need any help with anything at all, let me know. Searchman? Would you message Role if Izabella needs anything? I know how hard it is being in a foreign country on.... your own.&quot; 

And Izabella was alone. Of that, Pen was certain. She would be, until Laika woke up.</span>

Searchman did not reply to the wishes sent to him. It forced the unsteady air around them to take hold.

&quot;Aah... Penelope.&quot; Izabella sighed and scooted closer, to place her hands on the side of the bed. &quot;<em>&#39;That is a nice name. It is strong and sturdy. Perfect for you.&#39;</em>&quot;

She looked down at the equipment helping Penelope recover. It was all so different than the contraptions forced onto her son. More of a enhancement to life, not a requirement. Whatever they faced, it had to take payment from her as well, even after reaping so much life from others.

&quot;<em>&#39;You seem to be healing well. That is good.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;Er- yes. It ahm...&quot; was pretty bad and she was lucky, is what she wanted to say, but that wasn&#39;t fair to Izabella. What right did she have to be the one awake right now? &quot;The doctors say I&#39;ll make a full recovery. Just a little more metal in my body than there was before.&quot; 

Pen smiled, trying to joke. That one felt more hollow. They were tiptoeing around each other, trying to be friendly-- Pen wasn&#39;t sure she liked it. Part of her chest had to be reconstructed. That felt like such a small cost now. Even if Izabella didn&#39;t resent that, Pen was sure Searchman did. His silence was never this cold. 

&quot;How long will you... be here?&quot; Pen knew the implications the question had, but she had to start somewhere.</span>

Izabella&#39;s brow immediately crossed with worry. That sounded very intense, scary, and this girl had no family around for it. The void that needed filled seemed to grab at her. It craved her to fall into the habit. 

&quot;<em>&#39;I will be here as long as it is needed.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella answered, her smile back but weak. &quot;<em>&#39;A week or so, at least.&#39;</em>&quot;

She didn&#39;t want to think about the wishes she had to follow, or the fact that there was even such a wish set in place. If it went on for seven days without improvement, that&#39;s what the plan was. Izabella nodded it away, quickly. She reached with a gentle hand.

&quot;<em>&#39;I am hoping for much longer, until I get kicked out for sticking around too long!&#39;</em>&quot; Her inflection seemed proud, though it was all lost in the monotonous translation. &quot;<em>&#39;Plus, I want to properly thank you. You and the other boy.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

Pen reached out and held Izabella&#39;s hand. They shared a bond now, despite meeting mere moments ago. &quot;Thank you for being here. It&#39;s important to be together now. I am sure you will be allowed to stay a long time.&quot; Laika would wake up. Pen couldn&#39;t let go of that hope. 

&quot;Enzan is a couple rooms down from me. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d love to see you. I know he mentioned he wanted to see you, Searchman.&quot; Pen had a tenancy to redirect people to his room when they visited her. Her calmer friends had done her the favor of bringing him gifts once or twice. She felt the urge to protect, and this was the only way until she was well enough to move around freely.</span>

Those words were a bright spot in Izabella&#39;s days here in Japan, even if they were uttered in such a dark voice by her translator. Laika had to wake up, and soon too. He was always such a light sleeper. This world is far too noisy for him to sleep through it all.

&quot;<em>&#39;I will go see him in a few minutes. I&#39;ll make sure Searchman speaks to him.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella assured. Searchman, on the other hand, did not sound enthused about the prospect. He closed his eyes even, and kept them so while continuing his task. 

&quot;<em>&#39;Maybe you can help me understand him, actually. Enzan.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella&#39;s smile dropped as she went back to a gentle hold. &quot;<em>&#39;The officials told me that Laika was protecting him when it happened. Is he an important person?&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

He and Laika are... close, too.&quot; She hadn&#39;t been sure it was her job to tell Izabella how close, but did it matter now? She had to know.

For some reason, the words she needed to say next broke her brave face. &quot;They-- they l-ove each other a lot.&quot; Tears flecked down Pen&#39;s face.  They were so fast, Pen recoiled from Izabella&#39;s hand to try and calm them. She rubbed her eyes, and it was a minute before she could speak again. 

&quot;S-sorry. I just ah-- I love them too. A lot&#39;s happened to E-enzan. He lived with me before Lai-ka came to h-h-help.&quot; Pen finished out some hiccups and fumbled for a glass of water.</span>

Izabella stood up in an instant, and her hand was up to try and soothe. She stopped short when Penelope caught the tears on her own. She tried to smile, apologize without word. Searchman translated the words all the same, and her face seemed to twist. 

&quot;<em>&#39;Here, here.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella trotted around the bed and got the glass. She offered it to Penelope, well within reach. The words bounced around in her head. Love? What kind? She didn&#39;t speak as if Laika was hers.

&quot;<em>&#39;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t realize it was so sensitive.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella fidgeted with her hair, tucking it behind her ear. &quot;<em>&#39;I won&#39;t ask anymore. That was enough to understand, I think.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

She grabbed the paper cup in both hands and started to sip. 

&quot;I can talk about them it&#39;s ju-just I need a m-inute.&quot; Her latest memory of Enzan was over that video call.

The mystery laid heavy on her thoughts, and Izabella sought out a seat again. It was back to the stool, but that didn&#39;t keep her from soothing Penelope some more. Her hand rested on the bed.

&quot;You will probably see enough of that. I am okay now.&quot; she was smiling already. &quot;What would you like to know about Enzan? If I can&#39;t answer, Role can.&quot; At her name, Role popped out of her PET and stood on Pen&#39;s thigh. She eyed Searchman warily, but smiled at Izabella.</span>

She understood release. She had certainly done the same thing in the quiet corner of her dorm room almost every night since arriving. 

Izabella sat quiet for a moment as she tried to figure out a question. Really, what Penelope already stated was enough, but her penchant for gossip begged for more.

&quot;<em>&#39;He went to go try and bring my son back, even when he was in danger himself.&#39;</em>&quot; She stated cautiously. &quot;<em>&#39;I am still trying to understand why. I think I know the answer but it is... surprising. Foreign.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Izabella&#39;s eyes widened when her suspicion was confirmed. &#39;Partners,&#39; as the navi defined them. She had used the same word to lessen the blow in her youth, her brother never seemed to get as upset. The memory brought a smile, but that cracked through to the core of how she felt. Her breath was sharp as she took it in. No, no, don&#39;t cry. This was a happy thing, right? Her son had finally found someone, just when she was getting worried.

&quot;<em>&#39;No wonder he never told me.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella laughed. &quot;<em>&#39;I&#39;d want to meet him right away, and I wouldn&#39;t be able to. Hah!&#39;</em>&quot;

She calmed down quickly, and caught the few tears that hung out of her eyes. Just that small piece put everything together. Motives and secrets and Laika&#39;s every so careful dancing around the subject. Everything.

&quot;<em>&#39;A year though. I believe that was the same amount of time between my husband and I before we-&#39;</em>&quot; Searchman stopped as Izabella shook her head. &quot;Nyet nyet nyet--&quot;

&quot;<em>&#39;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Laika held the same level of selflessness.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella switched back on her topic. &quot;<em>&#39;Laika always mentioned nameless comrades and how well he liked to work with them. Maybe those were his stories about Enzan. Hm?&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

I&#39;m impressed he even told me.&quot; Her tears were interrupted by wistful smiles-- what was she doing? They were both alive, they would be fine and all have lots of time to laugh about relationships and how it was all over-- 

Role had to jump in again for Pen, <em>&quot;I&#39;m sure they were. He&#39;s always liked Enzan best. We&#39;ve only become friends through Enzan. He took a great risk to help him...their enemy was strong.&quot;</em> Role looked to Searchman for any kind of acknowledgement. He knew the most about this. He wasn&#39;t the only one mourning dammit! Role&#39;s hair flickered. He wasn&#39;t the only one subjected to this horribleness. If anything, he should be by Enzan&#39;s side. 

Pen tried to remain focused on their relationship. Now that it was in the open, fond memories could be shared and held onto. It was the only way through. 

&quot;One time, I remember Enzan stopped by my appartment to dodge his guards just to see Laika when he was supposed to be working. Laika brings out very, very nice things in Enzan.&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>&#39;Always liked Enzan best, hm?&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella looked up in thought. She could remember a time when he came home for a weekend supper, and was just back from a trip to Japan. One of the firsts. &quot;<em>&#39;Ah wait-&#39;</em>&quot;

Izabella looked like a realization just hit her, something she should&#39;ve thought of a long time ago. In her grief, she didn&#39;t realize how familiar all of this was sounding. Laika had let slip a few names, from time to time. Either off his lips or Iriya&#39;s. IPC was the company that made PETs weren&#39;t they? And Enzan... Enzan... she felt like she&#39;d seen the face before.

Her other hand came up to land on the bedside as she realized. White and black hair, like what she saw on TV a few times! Her son always went for the top, but this--?!

&quot;<em>&#39;Guards, oh my. You just now made me realize how big of a deal he is.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella seemed a little <em>too</em> happy with that fact. She dropped it immediately and looked to Penelope in question. &quot;<em>&#39;I suppose he isn&#39;t a fan of being recognized. How should I talk to him when I go see him?&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>&#39;Well, since I have that advice, I can talk to you about you.&#39;</em>&quot; she smiled. It was rude to talk about others like this. 

Izabella sighed, appreciating the bit of good that had emerged from all this. Penelope seemed good, very good. Motherly instincts were taking over, very quickly.

&quot;<em>&#39;Can you tell me more about yourself? You said you&#39;re from Netopia. That&#39;s far away from here.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

It was all good conversation fodder, for next time. Izabella just hoped that she could remember it all when she left the room. She could feel the draw of heartache waiting for her there.

With the question returned to her, Izabella rocked back. &quot;<em>&#39;Aah, definitely not as entertaining as you.&#39;</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>&#39;Where I come from is obvious. Not as many siblings, just myself and my brother. Our parents passed during the revolution. My brother is the success, he runs the base back home. While he worked so hard I, aha, got in trouble I guess. Met my husband.&#39;</em>&quot;

The hand she wanted to hold was drawn away. This was a rather abrupt end, but it was time to go. Penelope&#39;s intent was obvious. Izabella focused on Searchman&#39;s translation, and smiled.

&quot;<em>&#39;I will be stopping by very often. I assure you.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella patted the mattress with her hand. With plenty of gifts too, as many as she could manage to make. &quot;<em>&#39;Thank you again.&#39;</em>&quot;

                    <span class="markdown">Pen hated to see Izabella go, but next time would be smoother. Besides, if she stayed more the hospital would kick her out before she got to see Enzan.

&quot;Oh? Ah-- I guess... apples and peaches? I like most fruit though. It&#39;s very hard to pick.&quot; Pen smiled once her confusion was dispelled. She could practically taste her father&#39;s cobblers as she spoke. The surprise was something to look forward to, so she didn&#39;t ask why Izabella wanted to know.

&quot;Oh, and Enzan will never tell you, but he likes sour fruit.&quot; Paired with something very sweet, just like how he over sweetened everything else.

Now that Izabella was going to leave, a hundred more things to tell her were jumbling up her head. What if Enzan needed her to know about his hands? His wounds? His family? Her chest tightened-- every topic was an hour long conversation. The fruit would have to do.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Izabella put a finger to her chin in thought. She smirked, in the same way as Laika would. Uncannily exact, in fact, like his spirit was in the room for a moment and had taken over.

&quot;<em>&#39;I would make that work~&#39;</em>&quot; she mused to herself, yet Searchman translated it anyways. His voice brought Izabella back to focus on Pen. She bowed her head again, and waved. 

&quot;<em>&#39;Thank you again, for so many things. I will be back soon. Not tonight, but maybe tomorrow. For now, you rest. Heal up so that we can both bother them.&#39;</em>&quot; 

The happy idea made her chest ache in longing. She wanted it so badly, she wanted it right now. Paitence was hard when such looming deadlines grew closer and closer. 

With nothing more to say, Izabella took her leave with one more &#39;Dobroy nochi&#39;. She had another room to visit before leaving the place for her own small healings. This was probably the most important visit. She spoke softly to Searchman as she travsered down the halls. He hurt so much that she could feel the tight knot weighing like lead in her pocket. So many different negative emotions, and unable to properly express them. He had control for now, and she urged him to keep it at least until her visit with Enzan was done. 

Soon, she was at his door, back up in the levels of intensive care. Rough fingers pressed the bell that would alert a navi to come check. Izabella&#39;s smile was put back, but not a cheery as when she had left Penelope&#39;s room.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan was flat on his back. He couldn&#39;t sit up on his own, he could not walk, and he could not move his hands above his shoulders. The doctors and nurses said it was a miracle he&#39;d been able to move at all after dropping crossfusion. All of the damage combined with smoke inhalation and his mental trauma meant months of recovery. 

When the door chimed, Enzan tapped his PET. Blues left his Copyroid and checked who it was. 

&quot;Mrs. Izabella Byrukov, sir. She has fifteen minutes of visit time left.&quot; Blues spoke softly, just enough for Enzan to hear. 

&quot;Let her in...&quot; Enzan wasn&#39;t sure he was ready, but he never would be. He knew there wasn&#39;t intimate time to waste; they had to know each other. The door slid open, and Enzan could see her in his periferial vision. The color, her face-- Enzan felt his breath be taken and his heart speed up a tick. Dammit.</span>

&quot;<em>&#39;Pardon the intrusion.&#39;</em>&quot; Searchman&#39;s translation came out as Izabella bowed with some effort. It wasn&#39;t until she was back up that she looked to fully realize the form in bed.

The poor boy was just as wrapped up as her own, but lacked the more obvious external life support. Izabella dared to step closer, mostly so that her short stature could be on view without Enzan straining himself. Her smile remained, as calm as she could keep it. 

&quot;<em>&#39;I hope this is a good time, I heard that you needed a visitor or two.&#39;</em>&quot; She spoke soft, trying not to shatter the mood of the room. &quot;<em>&#39;So, I thought it would be good to finally come see you.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

Blues appeared and sat beside Enzan&#39;s hand as a hologram. There was nothing he could say or do to help the other three in the room, and it pained him. Every exploration of a plan to offer support ended badly in his predictive outputs. For now, all there was to do was sit. Be with them. 

&quot;I have heard a lot about you,&quot; Enzan croaked, &quot;it&#39;s an honor to finally meet.&quot; It was easy to talk using empty formality. The words were familiar, and easy to rehash and sound pretty even from his position. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;ve recovered, Searchman.&quot; The voice gave some small comfort, even if he wasn&#39;t really <em>there</em>. It was like a real part of Laika was here, awake, not just reflected in the eyes of his mother.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Searchman did not reply to anything directed to him. Just like Penelope and Role, the silent treatment stood to keep his current operator&#39;s needs attended to. He stared straight ahead towards the back wall, at attention.

&quot;<em>&#39;I don&#39;t believe there was that much to say about me.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella joked, trying to spark some warmth. These damn rooms were all too cold, even for her. &quot;<em>&#39;But it is indeed an honor for me too, Mr. Ijuuin.&#39;</em>&quot;

The formality was far too stuffy for her to endure. With all the other weight bearing down on her shoulders, Izabella couldn&#39;t add the unessential. Her smile dropped for a moment as she looked around for a stool. It wasn&#39;t nearby the bed like Penelope&#39;s and Laika&#39;s rooms. 

&quot;<em>&#39;Please call me Izabella. I&#39;m still too rough to be an old woman.&#39;</em>&quot; She rolled the stool over and sat down. All this sitting by hospital beds was surely unhealthy. &quot;<em>&#39;And I will call you Enzan in turn!&#39;</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>&#39;... How are you? Penelope told me to ask.&#39;</em>&quot; Her smile was back. It was a lie, but Izabella couldn&#39;t find reason to ask herself.</span>

&quot;Mrs... ah, Izabella. Thank you for coming, but I understand if you don&#39;t want to be here.&quot; Enzan&#39;s semi-mobile hand tapped his PET. He shut his eyes. That wasn&#39;t exactly what he&#39;d wanted to say.

                    <span class="markdown">The news was good, thankfully. Izabella nodded along with Searchman&#39;s translation. The body was healing with a little help, and that&#39;s all she could ask for those who brought her son back.

Her eyebrows raised when he turned his head. It was a surprise to see him look her way, because she had already been ready to stare at his hair for the entirety of the visit. She understood completely, why he didn&#39;t want to look. It was a new understanding, easy to put together. When had her familiarity with Laika turn into a curse?

&quot;<em>&#39;No, I... would much rather be here. Right now.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella found it hard to keep smiling. Being reminded as to why she was here was painful, every time. &quot;<em>&#39;You&#39;ve done something very great, and I am grateful. Beyond grateful, actually.&#39;</em>&quot;

She breathed in a bit, and reached forward. Enzan&#39;s hand wasn&#39;t as easy to touch, see sensed. It would hurt if she touched it, but placing her hand close was also good. A lump developed in her throat as a wave of emotion hit. Now that she knew the lengths he&#39;d go for her son, this was even harder to say.

&quot;<em>&#39;Enzan, I came to say thank you.&#39;</em>&quot; she looked up, eyes fixed on Enzan. Old and glassy, but still that same ocean blue. &quot;<em>&#39;Thank you so much... for saving him. I am in your debt.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;I cannot accept your thanks. Not yet, at least. Penelope is the one that deserves it.&quot; He resumed analyzing the ceiling. 

Though he felt so cold, Enzan turned his hand palm up beside hers. She was a warm presence, so long as she didn&#39;t see Laika&#39;s lifelessness on her face. Formality was falling away on Izabella&#39;s insistance. The force of it felt like a tear in Enzan&#39;s chest. Stating things like a report allowed him to disconnect, like the events were someone elses crime. 

&quot;There is no debt. You are here; that is more than enough.&quot; He didn&#39;t feel like he deserved even that much. She probably felt she had to be here, but how it must hurt to see the cause of all this, awake and aware, and her son dying. She must be just as bitter as he was, when Blues was taken away and Rockman <em>remained</em>. 

Enzan certainly felt he deserved that same punch he dolled out to Netto over it.</span>

A sense of failure, despite all that was achieved. With so much struggle, simply getting to bring back the battered body of your loved one just wasn&#39;t enough, was it?

Izabella glanced down, and saw where Enzan had his offer. Her hand move to cover his palm, simply laying there. 

&quot;<em>&#39;I want you safe, healed. Just as much as I want Him safe and healed.&#39;</em>&quot; Her lips curled up in a smile. It was warm. &quot;<em>&#39;You all deserve that. I will do my best to help you get there.&#39;</em>&quot;

With Enzan, moreso. She was indebted to him in other ways, ways she couldn&#39;t describe. It was simply a motherly instinct. She had to pamper him, just a little, in Laika&#39;s stead.

&quot;<em>&#39;I can visit more. We can talk. As much or as little as you like.&#39;</em>&quot; She added.</span>

This didn&#39;t change that Enzan thought he should be in Laika&#39;s place. 

It was important he get to know this woman better. 

&quot;Izabella, I do not know exactly how much Laika told you about me. However, in light of the situation, you should know. About us. Laika and I have-- we started dating in November, two years ago.&quot; So, despite the long lapses between, they had been together for over a year. Coming up on a year and a half. Darker thoughts took hold. Enzan felt like he was teetering on a ledge. Maybe he shouldn&#39;t have brought this up-- crying in front of a woman he just met was not on his list of things to do. 

&quot;He protected me.&quot; The feeling struck him, that even if Izabella didn&#39;t blame him, Searchman must. He hadn&#39;t visited yet. He hadn&#39;t answered Blues&#39; messages. He was mourning, yes, but Enzan was desperate to mourn together.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The smile stayed as Enzan spoke more. Izabella was relieved to hear that he wouldn&#39;t shut her out. She listened calmly, attentively, as Searchman translated back to her. Her brow strayed upwards as more detail of the relationship was revealed. It was just a little more than what she was just told but... Enzan was sure to tell her first thing. 

&quot;<em>&#39;He didn&#39;t tell me.&#39;</em>&quot; She needed to state that. &quot;<em>&#39;For his security, I&#39;m assuming. It&#39;s still hard for Sharo to accept.&#39;</em>&quot;

Her fingers moved slightly, changing to grip Enzan&#39;s hand loosely. Just enough to get the point across. The news didn&#39;t make her shy away, even if she was being told a second time.

&quot;<em>&#39;I hope you don&#39;t mind... Penelope told me before I came. It&#39;s still so new, but I&#39;m happy to learn it. So happy.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella&#39;s smile broke into a grin for a moment as a tear escaped her. She bent down quick to hide it with her curly hair. &quot;<em>&#39;Mom&#39;s worry about very strange things.&#39;</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>&#39;He, he cares a lot about others. You know that. He is already stupid enough to put himself on the line for strangers.&#39;</em>&quot; she continued, &quot;<em>&#39;Of course he would protect you. Above all else. He&#39;s going to be so happy to see you safe.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;It&#39;s alright. Penelope has good judgement-- most of the time.&quot; A pointed grin <em>almost</em> made it to his face. Not quite though. As soon as Laika was the focus again, he was back to neutral.

&quot;Thank you. I hope so.&quot; The harshest fear that Enzan had clawed its way to the forefront of his mind. How much did Izabella know about what happened? Did she know there was a chance a monster would wake up in her son&#39;s place? 

&quot;Izabella-- I-- I really did. I <em>thought</em> I was doing everything I could. I love--&quot; His face contorted, as more words he would have rather left unspoken escaped.</span>

The release was part of the process for all of them. She stood, not really gaining much high, to come closer. Her other hand hesitantly reached for his hair.

&quot;<em>&#39;You&#39;re the same, I get the feeling.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella&#39;s voice got softer. &quot;<em>&#39;For him, you did everything and more. You did, you did-&#39;</em>&quot;

The lump in her throat cut her off. At this rate they would both be an absolute mess. She couldn&#39;t hold it back anymore! Not even with her years of experience. She didn&#39;t ask for permission, she just put her hand forward. Fingers threaded into Enzan&#39;s hair, gently brushing his hair so that it looked less messy. Dust from dry shampoo stuck to her skin, but she didn&#39;t care. He deserved to look better, feel just a little better.

&quot;<em>&#39;You can let it out. He&#39;s going- to be okay--&#39;</em>&quot; She bit back her sob. No crying, not until he started. This was so rough but necessary. Yet all her emotion went untranslated as Searchman started beyond them towards the window. &quot;<em>&#39;He&#39;ll be back before we know it.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;I wasn&#39;t smart en-ough, or f-ast enough.&quot; He sobbed, finally succumbing to the pressures from his body and mind. He squeezed her hand with all his strength-- which right now, wasn&#39;t much. Tears rolled down his bruised cheeks. 

&quot;I should h-have held out longer-- he&#39;s gone because I was b-broken-- I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry Izabella. S-searchman-- I swear I love him.&quot; It wasn&#39;t enough, nothing he did was enough, and no one had helped them. Even this release was bitter. He didn&#39;t want anyone to see. Not even Blues, and not a stranger. He was wracking up weaknesses and fissures more and more. The scars by now, he was sure, made up more of his body than his strengths ever had. 

&quot;Please, please, don&#39;t forgive me yet. I don&#39;t deserve it. I can&#39;t a-accept it--&quot; his eyes shut off from the blank ceiling. There was nothing comforting about the memorization of speckled tiles.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The weak grasp is what finally got past Izabella&#39;s barrier. She had kept having hallucinations of such a weak grasp returning hers, but Laika never actually <em>moved</em>. Tears escaped before she could catch them, falling to stick in her hair and clothes. They didn&#39;t stop her from soothing Enzan, or listening to his translated word.

Searchman&#39;s voice quality did not change, even as human emotions flared.

&quot;Sshhh... Sshhh...&quot; Izabella moved her hands. More of Enzan&#39;s hair was taken into the motions, and her thumb left his palm briefly to run gently across her own face. &quot;Выпустите это...&quot; 

She didn&#39;t even notice the absence. Izabella was a mother now, doing her work to soothe and ensure everything was okay with the young ones. She did good work even as her own tears fell. It was just so sad, all of this.

What could&#39;ve she done more? The question of if she could&#39;ve saved Laika from any of this kept coming up, plaguing her like it did Enzan. She couldn&#39;t. Her form shuddered, and she shook her head. She would just sob along side Enzan, holding with him the same weight.</span>

Enzan held onto Izabella&#39;s hand for dear life. All these days he had been drowning, and this was the first sign of a life preserver. 

Even so, it was tainted by Searchman&#39;s departure. It validated all of Enzan&#39;s self deprecation. 

More apologies spilled from him, but he stopped putting effort into making sense. Any words he had were only for his own benefit now. 

God, he just wanted to be held and promised everything would be alright. He sobbed harder at the thought, because only Laika could ever do that for him.</span>

The grief he held in him made her tremble. That vast, black, turbulent sea. His was easily as big as hers, if not bigger now that Searchman had retreated. She sought to comfort over and over, to give to him what she couldn&#39;t to Laika. 

Bleary eyes watched as she gingerly tried to deepen their holds on each other. One hand was locked in his grasps, but Izabella could use the other to guide his head as she leaned in. Her cheek gently collided with his temple in a hug, the best she could manage with his wounds so severe. 

Admist her hiccups, soft mutterings in a foreign tongue met Enzan&#39;s apologizes. Bids to settle, to breathe, small obvious promises that she was here and that she would stay. Her own upset waned after a time, yet she still kept up the softness until Enzan was done.</span>

Tried to slow his breathing, because crying in such a full-bodied way was starting to really hurt. His chest ached, and every hiccup made his back jolt with pain. 

His crying turned into complaints of the pain. Blues fretted by his hand, not wanting to distress him more but also eager to at least see if he could get more pain relievers. 

&quot;б-лагодарю вас...&quot; Enzan finally wheezed. The attempt was rather clumsy, but understandable.</span>

She couldn&#39;t help but smile at the attempt of thanks. Her hand came up to thread through Enzan&#39;s hair again. She had to pull away to get tissues, to help settle down and keep healing. 

&quot;Вот...&quot; She took it upon herself to dab his tears away. There were some indistinct mumblings after, short little phrases of no consequence to Enzan. With a sigh, Izabella tucked her hair behind her shoulders.

&quot;<em>&#39;What else do you need? I don&#39;t want to leave you in pain-&#39;</em> Ah...&quot; Izabella was surprised to hear her translator return. She looked confused for a moment. Did the other navi bring him back? Or maybe Enzan&#39;s fitting did. &quot;<em>&#39;Water, a warm towel. Just let me know.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

He couldn&#39;t talk right away to answer her. He knew if he tried, the spicket would never stop pouring. 

It was hurting him to move, so he forced his body to still its hiccups. As practiced as he was, it was still difficult to stop when mouring was all his mind could circle around. The tension was palpable; it made him red in the face. 

He coughed and swallowed, finally clearing enough to speak. &quot;B-lues will let the nurse know. But-- water, please.&quot;</span>

She sniffed and stood, leaving Enzan&#39;s side to go to the room&#39;s bathroom. After a moment&#39;s run of the tap she was back, cradling a cup of water between her worn hands. Izabella offered it at first, but quickly realized that Enzan probably couldn&#39;t hold it himself, not at the moment. Moving like that would be painful to, probably.

In all the times he had been hurt before, even when his mobility had been limited, he was never this dependent. 

&quot;That&#39;s enough. Thank you.&quot; Enzan stared back up at the ceiling. He was exhausted. In relaxing from the tears, he truly settled into these new pains. They strained his voice, and his ability to emote. No matter how much he cried, he still wanted to assure them both that he would do anything to change this. He would have remained in that white box of a room if it meant Laika and his family was safe at home. 

&quot;I apologize. That was a lot... at once.&quot; Replacements for his darker thoughts were laid out. His hand found its place to rest on the bedside, palm up. 

His more selfish wish burst out. A different voice than Enzan had used so far broke out. He truly sounded his age.  &quot;Will you... visit again?&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>&#39;It&#39;s alright, dear... just, don&#39;t hurt yourself.&#39;</em>&quot; Izabella let a small laugh escape. Looking down, she spotted that same invitation from before their upset. With the question, it was easily taken. Her hand sat on top of his.

&quot;<em>&#39;Absolutely. Tomorrow even. Every day if you want. It&#39;ll help you, probably. But it&#39;ll certainly help me.&#39;</em>&quot; Her brow creased for a moment, as she stiffled another round of upset. &quot;<em>&#39;I want to know as much as I can about you.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Blues will want to talk with you.&quot;  How could he say anything  positive about himself right now? Blues was better equipped.  &quot;I... have heard much about yourself, but from your own mouth would be welcome.&quot; 

It was getting hard to talk like this again. A lot of emotional strength was being put out, too soon after crying. The bursts of energy were quick to burn to the wick.</span>

She tilted her head a little at the idea of talking with his navi. A glance was given to the small red-armored man standing dutifully by where their hands touched. Was that offer meant for Searchman? A small hint at what that navi desired? Izabella took it as much and nodded.

&quot;<em>&#39;Oh dear that can&#39;t be good.&#39;</em>&quot; she tried to laugh. &quot;<em>&#39;I&#39;ll have to fix the stories.&#39;</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>&#39;You should rest more.&#39;</em>&quot; Her hand pulled away a little. &quot;<em>&#39;I&#39;m sure a nurse will be here soon to kick me out. I don&#39;t have a PET for myself so- for the time being. You&#39;ll have to reach me through Searchman.&#39;</em>&quot;

Blues nodded up to her. 

But, even as dutifully as Searchman was serving Izabella, it seemed like he wasn&#39;t really here. Both boys hated the idea of making him perform when he couldn&#39;t <em>truely</em> choose to. 

Besides, for Enzan, Searchman was the line to Laika. Sure, he valued his tall friend as a navi, but they came as a pair.

It needed to look tidy, even if all he would be doing for the rest of the night was sleep. She had done the same to Laika, whatever part of his hair she could reach. Maybe it was too much, but she felt noticeably better for it.

Blues&#39; words went untranslated for a second. Izabella stood as if she didn&#39;t hear them, but the lack of understanding made her pause. A glance to her shoulder confirmed that Searchman was still there. He didn&#39;t seem to react, like he didn&#39;t hear. But that was impossible. The navi could hear just about everything.

&quot;Searchman?&quot; 

&quot;<em>He asked if you would like company to the exit.</em>&quot; He replied quickly.

Izabella squinted, but shook her head and addressed Blues with a smile. &quot;<em>&#39;That would be fine, as long as Enzan is okay with it.&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

He nodded, but not without reservations. &quot;Be quick, Blues.&quot; 

Blues bowed deeply to all three of them. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Searchman&#39;s reaction stung deep, but Blues didn&#39;t think it was personal. Even the hurt he felt was empathetic. Blues knew deep in his core that under these same circumstances, he would never reactivate his own emotion data again. And should the worst come, deletion would follow. 

He knew this. And it had been on his mind a while. He didn&#39;t blame Searchman or want to try and stop him thinking these things. He just wanted to be with his dear friend in <em>this</em> moment.</span>

They would all be okay. Everyone. Even Laika. That hope she had to keep hold close to her heart, even if it was fragile. 

&quot;<em>&#39;He&#39;ll come home safe and sound.&#39;</em>&quot; She promised. &quot;<em>&#39;Have a good night, Enzan. Please rest.&#39;</em>&quot; 

With that, the mother left. She began her silent walk out of the wards. A hand passed through her own hair with a sigh, as thoughts of tomorrow swirled around her head. It would be day five. 

In his PET, Searchman stood with a guest. Blues was hard to look at, his glaring red harsh against the dark greys and greens of the space around them. He so desperately wanted to pull up work, find something to keep himself busy so that Blues couldn&#39;t be spoken to, yet nothing could be thought of. 

&quot;<em>You are here to check on me.</em>&quot; he guessed. &quot;<em>Are you not?</em>&quot;</span>

Searchman changed. For a moment his face skewed as something churned underneath the skin. It was gone in a second, but the feeling lingered. Frustration and remorse, towards what, it was unclear.

However, Searchman&#39;s last suggestion gave Blues pause. Did he think Blues wasn&#39;t doing enough for Laika? Was there something he <em>could</em> do? Would offering ease some of his friend&#39;s burden?

That would be the last thing Searchman wanted, because he will not be absent. Even now a satellite was sitting in Laika&#39;s room network, watching in silence as nurses and their navis come and go. Blues didn&#39;t need to know that. 

But he went back to what was said before. Searchman hated the reaction he was getting from those words. It begged him to yield, to sit. But what then? He couldn&#39;t figure it out. 

His head simply bowed a little more. Searchman closed his eyes.

&quot;<em>I apologize. I cannot be what I was before. It is not possible now. I must do my duties. I have many.</em>&quot;</span>

He needed to think about their differences, not their similarities now. What did Searchman need, that Blues wasn&#39;t thinking of? 

He pushed to his feet and stood close to Searchman. <em>&quot;We must all do our duties. But to function fully, we must not neglect ourselves. That is why I am here. I cannot serve Enzan-sama properly when I know I have not even tried to be with you.&quot;</em> 

Blues reached his hand out, tenderly. He touched Searchman&#39;s hand, the one intended for battle. <em>&quot;We do not have to talk. We can simply be in company.&quot;</em></span>

It was fully expected for him to just black out or be in sudden, irreparable pain. None of that came though, just a dull ache in his core as contact slowly registered as good.

&quot;<em>... Very well.</em>&quot; Searchman muttered. 

He went silent, keeping his eyes closed for a second more. When they opened, they couldn&#39;t look at Blues. They found a place beyond him, uninteresting bits floating in the distance.</span>

They could not have contact with their operators, not properly. There was no warmth or love to be found in the hospital walls, so they had to seek it out themselves. No organic warmth, but at least they could have this. 

<em>&quot;I will try not to push your boundaries.&quot;</em> Blues finally spoke up again, <em>&quot;but I will not leave you alone.&quot;</em></span>

It was just so long ago, many moons before his current place. Such a goodness seemed out of place. He wasn&#39;t sure he deserved it, but he would let it come.

&quot;<em>...</em>&quot;

He stood with Blues until Izabella reached the hospital lobby. The PET&#39;s space shifted slightly as she pulled it out of her apron. Her face appeared on a screen, with a large tree looming behind her.

Searchman broke away, gently, without a word. It was time for Blues to go. He stepped back and allowed much space between him and the portal to the net. His eyes finally fell on the red navi again, though they seemed just a little less empty than before. 

&quot;<em>&#39;Thank you for walking us out.&#39;</em>&quot; Search only spoke to parrot his mother. &quot;<em>&#39;I plan to bring in something sweet for Pen. Can I drop some off for Enzan as well?&#39;</em>&quot;</span>

Izabella nodded with a smile over Searchman&#39;s blank stare. After farewells, he watched as Blues left to go back to Enzan. Alone again, and for the first time since revival, it wasn&#39;t exactly cared for. The solidtude he found comfort in didn&#39;t feel as good. 

&quot;Searchman.&quot; Izabella&#39;s voice had him lift his head. Her words were crystal clear to him. &quot;Are you and him... also...?&quot;

&quot;<em>No.</em>&quot; He answered quickly. &quot;<em>He loves someone else. We are friends, perhaps a little closer due to our operators.</em>&quot;

The answer didn&#39;t seem to work. Izabella looked confused. She shrugged it off and began walking. Searchman felt his world enter a known sway. Was what Blues did too intimate? Curious questions came up, though Searchman quickly quelled them. It didn&#39;t matter, he needed to focus on his duties. If he let himself wander, there was no way he&#39;d be fit for his job. Not right now.</span>
