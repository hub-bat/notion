                <div class="chatlog__content">
                    <span class="markdown">His breath was frozen like the home he abandoned, cold in this space he had been occupying for what felt like a millenium- and he knew the way time could shift and bend in that way. When was the last time he had seen another soul in this place? Could he even count the days back- did he even know what day it was now?
His internal clock had broken long ago, and attempts to page home were futile. His fall from the sun, his charred wings- this was what he had come to deserve. His eyes closed, reminded of his last encounter...
<em>&quot;He&#39;s replacing me. With you. How fitting,&quot; a low, bitter laugh. A single eye pulsed in the dark. &quot;Not quite replacing. Upgrading, so to speak.&quot;</em> 
A hand gripped at his arm, he identified it as his own. Pressure caused the stars trapped within him to grow hot. He shook his head. Another day...Or perhaps another few. He could not tell anymore. 
A warm soul...He allowed himself to recall that moment. Why had his once enemy aided him? It made no sense..But in the end, if he had been deleted back then- he would not be here now. Perhaps the hero was one of forethought- and wished this punishment upon him. Perhaps he should have been left to die...Where else was there to go, then back to the stars?
--
He jolted awake at a <em>sound.</em> Nothing else was in this space- nothing else could have made even the sound of a pin dropping, let alone...static. An opening! A flurry of color flodded his vision, a technicolor wave of confusion-
and he was out. 
<em>Find the one called Firebird.</em>
--
A difficult one to track down- the undernet bore little answers, and more questions of the validity of his nature. Eventually- he was close to giving up, resigning to failing whoever had freed him. His last effort was a message on the undernet BBS board:
[I AM LOOKING FOR THE ONE KNOWN AS FIREBIRD.]
[WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL. I CAN OFFER YOU INVALUABLE INFORMATION.]
[I AM COSMOMAN. FORMER LEADER OF THE DARKCHIP SYNDICATE.]
[I KNOW WHERE HE IS.]</span>

Countershade walked away from the BBS with a swift step. He had hopes that his keeper wasn&#39;t watching over his shoulder. The message was almost too tantalizing, even for himself. It was obviously something suspicious, too much so to look into.

But sadly, it seemed to have done its job. Countershade stopped in his tracks as a silent message flashed. &#39;Reply.&#39;

&quot;<em>Yer playin&#39; with... nevermind...</em>&quot; Countershade grumbled as he turned back around. Of course the great &#39;Firebird&#39; knew what they were getting themselves into. Nevermind the tight grip that Countershade could feel gripped around the PET he was tethered to.

Cosmoman felt waves of a feeling unidentifiable wash over him- he wondered, vaguely, if there was some higher power at work here. That place...He had come to find out just how holy it was.
<em>No,</em> he thought, <em>I&#39;ve already spent my divine intervention.</em>
It took a great deal of effort to sneak back into the hospital network. They had clearly done some remodeling since his departure- but he knew well enough which room to venture to.
It was colder, somehow. Cosmoman did not know if he was late or early- time, as ever, was still unknown to him. He waited, patiently. 
&quot;Firebird,&quot; he muttered under breath. &quot;Where did...hear of such a...figure, I wonder.....&quot;</span>

It was annoying, almost. Why did he have to be forced to see this place? The guilt felt misplaced, yet we&#39;ll deserved.

&quot;<em>Four o&#39;clock... to th&#39; second.</em>&quot; Countershade grumbled as he sensed the other darkloid&#39;s arrival. &quot;<em>Think yer all fancy, don&#39;t&#39;cha?</em>&quot;

He was always looking to rise above it all, and wasn&#39;t shy to demean any who could rise to his self-proclaimed high level of existence. He was data like the rest of them, tainted with darkness that was both strength and weakness. 

And this so-called &#39;Lord of the Heavens&#39; was now <em>kneeling</em>? To him?

He straightened up after the remark, and listened to the rest. This all seemed too surreal. To go from being treated as fodder to be treated as a king was too much. Especially from the one who came to abduct him personally.

Countershade looked up for a few moments, as if in thought. He was listening to instructions. Questions had to be chosen not by him, but the leader. Who this meeting was all about.

&quot;<em>Which ally of T&#39; Firebird did y&#39; assist?</em>&quot;</span>

The small suprise seemed to go beyond Countershade. His shadow echoed the sentiment as it listened from afar. Rockman had done this recently?

&quot;<em>Sorry to burst y&#39; bubble, but I ain&#39;t considering Rockman an ally.</em>&quot; Countershade rolled his shoulders. &quot;<em>But yer lucky, cuz Firebird is.</em>&quot;

He took a few steps forward to look down at Cosmoman. It was made sure that his weapon was in sight.

He looked up at Countershade, trying to appear convicted in his desire to fight this...Monster.

The pleas did nothing to sway Countershade&#39;s stance. He hated this darkloid, fully. He didn&#39;t care that he was down on his luck and unable to find safety. In fact? He was a little <em>glad.</em>

Countershade went to speak again, but he was cut off by another voice. It was feminine, royal, but heated with contempt. Cosmoman had said something worthy of response from The Firebird. 

&quot;How do you know this? Matters that occur in his country are next to impossible to verify.&quot;</span>

Countershade pulled his free hand out of hiding, and with it beckoned Cosmoman to stand up. The whole kneeling thing was starting to get annoying. He would be blown away from Countershade&#39;s attack either way, should he make poor choices.

A singular, burning red over right eye was the only defining feature of Cosmoman&#39;s shadow. But it was strange- in the way that Cosmoman&#39;s shadow looked more <em>human</em> than alien, navi. 
&quot;He is controlling us. I was the hand that enabled his escape. A former ally of mine was the hand that <em>danced</em> with the Ijuuin son. But it was all this-&quot;

The small gasp in head had Countershade retract his stance. Firebird...?

&quot;<em>Just what&#39;re&#39;ya pullin&#39; from all this nonsense?</em>&quot; He grumbled under his breath. No sooner then that was said, he was back to standing down, as ordered.

There was a long pause after Cosmoman finished. Countershade was forced to stare at the other and his shadow awkwardly.

&quot;... This area is no longer secure. Nurses are beginning to make evening rounds. You will follow Countershade.&quot;

&quot;<em>What--?!</em>&quot;

&quot;Do it.&quot;

Countershade grumbled, and looked back to Cosmoman. Great. He had to allow this space cadet into his abode now.</span>

&quot;<em>We&#39;re takin&#39; back roads. Keep up.</em>&quot; He huffed.

They seemed to walk around in circles, ricocheting in and out of the hospital servers several times. The mind bending path home did well to confuse anyone who tried to tail Countershade, and he was slightly curious to see how it would affect someone who he was purposefully dragging along.

They finally arrived somewhere nondescript. It had no markers of what or where they were near. It was just a blank server, somewhere. After Cosmoman cleared the i/o podium, it shut off, effectively locking them both in.

A screen appeared overhead. Firebird was there.

&quot;You will reside here until your own space can be created. I control when you leave and exit.&quot; They stated. &quot;You will also be under surveillance, it should not be too different than what you are accustomed to.&quot;

&quot;L&#233;izer?&quot; He questioned, the name clearly unknown to him. &quot;Is that what they are calling themselves? That is...incorrect. That is a recreation of <em>Laserman.</em> &quot;
But it wasn&#39;t and- that was- his head had a dull ache. Cosmo hated what was done to him. 
&quot;Regal recreated them after my failure. They have become Regal&#39;s lapdog...But not with Laserman&#39;s consent. Laserman did not want to continue serving Regal as Nebula did not exist. Regal did not give them a choice...They did not give me a choice.&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>Funny how &#39;consent&#39; don&#39;t really exist for our kind.</em>&quot; Countershade scoffed. The movement of Firebird&#39;s head was enough to stop any further remarks. He shrugged and stepped away to have a seat.

&quot;We strongly suspected that they were not human, and that they had ties to the fugitive.&quot; Firebird&#39;s voice was straight, unwavering. &quot;However, the true identity is a small surprise. I was assuming that he had regained control of another Nebula leader.&quot;</span>

Just what was going through their head? He felt desperate to know in the moment. If that was true during the gala... during their chat and shopping... then...

Firebird&#39;s image seemed to freeze. For a second, Countershade actually wondered if something had disrupted the feed. But then a noise came through his receptors that was muted everywhere else. Wheezing and shuddered breath. A few quiet curses in a language he was barley allowed to understand.

Then they were gone. Countershade&#39;s eyes slimmed. They were pushing themselves.

&quot;I see. Then it is doubtful that &#39;L&#233;izer&#39; will approach me with ease again. He will have surely anticipated that you came to me.&quot;

They paused again, then lowered their head to a glower.

&quot;I am to suspect he preformed the same process with you...&quot;</span>

They are in great pain when Regal is present, and they have come to resent him. They want...The same as me. To just- to- let this <em>end.</em> &quot;
When he was prompted, prodded to explain further, his chest constricted. The stars dotted across his skin flickered- a sign of his anxiety. He chose his next words very, very carefully.

&quot;When will he try to sync with you again? With Laserman again?&quot; Firebird shot off the questions quickly. &quot;I do know that a human&#39;s fate is very similar to a navis when it comes to pulse transmission. If you were to be deleted while he was in control...&quot;

&quot;<em>Oi, oi...</em>&quot; Countershade spoke up. He looked up to the screen, sensing a scary amount of malice laced in those words. Too much like the <em>other</em> one.

&quot;<em>We need some fact checkin&#39; first. Yer takin&#39; things at face value.</em>&quot; He reasoned. &quot;<em>No incomin&#39; connections beside your own in this place, &#39;member? Regal couldn&#39;t reach him here if he tried.</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;I do not know. He is with Laserman nearly constantly now, all of his waking hours are spent using Laserman. He feels- he feels strong that way. He is very sick.&quot; He returned to the questions.
Cosmoman wanted to make a move to prompt Countershade to take the shot. He suppressed the urge. Conflicting emotions rose in his mind- was he more valuable alive, or was it safer in his death?
&quot;It could happen in any moment. He has not...made an attempt with myself in very long. Not since his escape.&quot;</span>

Firebird had stood up from the, and was repositioning themselves in the moments that Cosmoman spoke. One place for too long was dangerous.

Countershade understood the measures being taken, now that the fear of L&#233;izer was there. They could appear at any moment, as warned.

&quot;I will not give you a deletion just yet.&quot; Firebird ruled. Their voice had started to wither and crack. &quot;Everything said so far has been recorded, but there is still other things that you will answer for me.&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>Guess I gotta roommate.</em>&quot; He grumbled. His hand came out and pointed to the corner he was in before. &quot;<em>I&#39;m fond of that spot, don&#39;t take it.</em>&quot;

He huffed and settled down. It was a bad habit he picked up from being alone all the time. Someone had to talk and fill the void.

The thought of revenge brought a smile, though Countershade couldn&#39;t help but laugh. It was just a chuckle, but enough to challenge what was said.

&quot;<em>Believe me when I say that, of all of us, I&#39;m thinkin&#39; The Firebird wants that the most. You didn&#39;t hear how they changed tone earlier?</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>The only other thing I chatter with is Firebird&#39;s other navis. They&#39;re borin&#39;, too worried about the fella&#39;s safety.</em>&quot;</span>

There was a fair chance that was the case. &quot;Good reason? Do they assume you- er, I suppose us- will act out due to our darkloid status?&quot;
He felt prickles across his body now that he knew someone was watching. Someone else knew of his escape...Someone else knew of Rockman&#39;s mercy.
&quot;I hope I did not get Rockman in some level of trouble.&quot; He said, somewhat abruptly. &quot;He helped me for good reasons.&quot;</span>

He glanced around again. This space was so...empty. It was oddly nostalgic in a way.
 &quot;I am surprised Firebird knows of him and you do not. But- it doesn&#39;t very well matter I suppose...&quot;
He shifted on his knees until he was sitting back, legs out infront of him. He was a large navi- too awkward and gangly.</span>

Firebird zoomed in, sensing the anxiety the darkloid produced. There wasn&#39;t much to love about this picture, but it was the only one available without other related parties in shot. 

&quot;This event was through invitation only. From who did Leizer or Regal receive one?&quot;</span>

&quot;It is interesting that you bring up that name, Marcatto.&quot; They continued. &quot;From what I gather, they were forced to leave the gala early for medical reasons. Perhaps you could shed more light on what might&#39;ve happened there.

And nothing more was said on the subject. Firebird paused for a moment before moving on. Writing wasn&#39;t heard this time.

&quot;This event was a charity gala with auction. There were a few items that were available that L&#233;izer showed interest in.&quot;

A short list was brought up. &#39;C-15&#39; and &#39;S4V10R&#39; were listed. Other items included small PET parts that were barely worth noting.

Firebird highlighted the first two.

&quot;Should he have acquired these, what would he have used them for?&quot; they asked. &quot;Regal created these, did he not?&quot;</span>

The pictures were taken away, returning the feed back to Firebird. They were looking down, writing a little more. For Countershade, small mutterings could be heard. None of them good.

&quot;My final questions.&quot; They spoke up. A waved hand brought several satella viruses out of hiding. They pointed themselves toward Cosmoman.

&quot;<em>Pressure&#39;s a lil unneeded.</em>&quot; Countershade grumbled. He could tell that Cosmoman wasn&#39;t lying so far.

Firebird ignored the comment. &quot;Explain to me what you consider Regal&#39;s goals to be.&quot;</span>

It was written down regardless. Firebird seemed to stare at their notepad for a moment. They were thinking, wondering.

&quot;Are you willing to work against him?&quot; They asked. &quot;He has destroyed you, in every way except taking your life. Does that fuel anything in you?&quot;</span>

&quot;Yes.&quot; The answer was without hesitation. &quot;They are not the man I allied myself with long ago. They- are not the man who&#39;s life I saved.&quot;
If anything, Cosmoman felt sorrow for lost plans. He felt sorrow for the purpose he had lost.

&quot;Those are all of my questions.&quot; Firebird stated. &quot;The next is your choice.&quot;

They gestured, and Countershade took that as a direction to turn around. He faced Cosmoman with rifle showing.

&quot;Do you actually wish for deletion? Or do you want to stop this?&quot; Firebird&#39;s voice seemed to get rough. &quot;You will loose freedoms of you ally with me. However, you do live. You get to see <em>results.</em>&quot;</span>

&quot;I am willing to become a tool. I accept that deletion may be necessary.&quot;
Above all, selfishly, he wanted to return to the stars. He wished to travel with Duo again as he once did.

&quot;Yes,&quot; he finally said. &quot;I am far enough from who I was when Duo breathed life into me. What could more changes do?&quot;
Then, a grin, a smile indicating a more familiar man of the stars- &quot;And, perhaps I am interested to see if they can make heads or tails of me. If you can, you are much better than Regal ever will be.&quot;</span>

Firebird lifted their head, as if to ensure Cosmoman knew they were looking down on him. That fire mentioned seemed to flare up. Countershade sensed it, and turned his head. No need to watch Cosmoman for the moment. 

&quot;Regal and I have had the displeasure of meeting several times. Each time we both thought it would be the last we see of each other, and yet the next occurred.&quot;

Firebird brought a hand up to linger on the side of their helmet. &quot;I am surprised you haven&#39;t figured it out. Or maybe you&#39;re starting to. Either way, allies and pawns are privy to certain information. Who I am.&quot;

Their other hand came up, and both began to lifted the helmet off. Mint hair was mess as it was freed from the restraint. Cold eyes followed, with skin pale and marred by scars around the chin and ears. A face of a man who had died and been reborn, thanks in part to Cosmoman&#39;s actions.</span>

&quot;<em>I have no idea what&#39;ll happen after this.</em>&quot; He admitted. &quot;<em>It was different with me. I was just basecode, the rest he built back up from memory and desire. But yer functionin&#39; and all...</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>When y&#39; wake up, maybe we&#39;ll chat more. It&#39;ll past the time real easy.</em>&quot;</span>

Blotches filled his vision until he fell into a dark, dreamless state.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Countershade watched as Cosmoman fell. He was caught up by the rings of stasis, and lifted up and away. Eyes followed until Laika&#39;s image was seen.

There wasn&#39;t any emotion present, but still the fire hadn&#39;t been lost in his eyes.

&quot;<em>How long is he gonna be out y&#39;reckon?</em>&quot; Countershade spoke up.

Laika didn&#39;t respond immediately. He reached down and picked up his helmet. It was shoved on, as he stared at their new acquaintance.

&quot;I retrieved your code almost a year ago.&quot; Firebird replied. &quot;It took 2 months after I got approval.&quot;

Countershade mouthed an &#39;ah.&#39; It would have to be less time than that. Cosmoman was too valuable to be sitting on a shelf, he could sense that.

&quot;I am heading back. You&#39;re free to roam. Keep your knowledge to yourself down there.&quot; With that, Firebird cut out.

Countershade dropped his head. Cosmoman had vanished along with the feed. Troubling times were ahead.</span>
