[ Regal was doing him a favor. ]

[ Enzan Ijuuin’s PET was scheduled for maintenance and upgrades at the same time the boy himself was scheduled for an examination. Routine; for crossfusion. ]

“ Hello; Sorry for any inconvience, but Doctor Hikari will not be present today. ” [ The man bowed in front of Enzan, displaying a tactfully done impersonation of kindness. ] “ I am taking over his duties for today; that includes crossfusion examinations. ”

[ Regal, still bowed and staring at Enzan’s feet, smiled. ]

[ It was time. ]

 chaudandfriends
Enzan lifted his chin, suppressing the urge to display any of his nervous habits. Regal. Of all the scientists that work here.

“I see. Very well.”

A chilly air filled the room, nearly palpable. While not unusual for Enzan, it was increased by the man before him. The young man had never forgiven, and certainly never forgotten.

He sat down on the examination table, as he did every time. He concentrated on the crinkle of his hospital gown, as his heart rate rose.

That was all a long time ago.

His hand twitched, reaching for a phantom PET. He suppressed any further movement for now. Nothing was wrong. This was routine. Regal worked here. Enzan had had other scientists sub in before. This was fine.</span>

[ The anxiety was felt in waves; blanketing around Regal, making it difficult to stay composed. He wanted to jump now. He wanted this so very badly. He had finally realized the urge he got at the sight of Enzan, of Rockman of Blues– and he wanted them all. ]

“ I assure you, ” [ He began, a smile plastered on his features. It was believeable; it was one the man had gotten much practice for. An ignorant smile. ] “ You have nothing to worry about. This is just procedure. ”

[ Very slowly, a hand came down on Enzan’s shoulder. ]

“ Your PET will be finished with repairs before you’re even done. Lay back. ”

[ His opposite hand– his mechanical one– thumbed a small vial in his pocket. ]

 ijuinenzan
Enzan’s expression soured, hating how the man was reading his near neutral expression. The rest of his face remained cold, stoic, but his mouth shifted ever so slightly into a frown.

His internal voice screamed when Regal touched him, a shrieking in his ears and throbbing in the back of his head. Why did memories have to torment him like this?

He let on nothing. His pale legs shifted over the silver table, coming up to rest on the table. His back hit the cool metal, and he took a breath. Normal. This was all normal.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">[ Regal could feel the electricity, the anxiety coursing through Enzan just under his fingertips. His shoulders were tense and his expression a mask; this was already near perfect. ]

[ On a rolling table nearby laid his various tools; sadly very many would not be used. Yet. He pulled from the table a vial and butterfly needle, taking Enzan’s arm in his hand. Tying his arm without hesitation he jammed the needle in(knowing exactly where his vein was, exactly where it could be). ]

“ It will only hurt for a moment. “ [ A little late; he didn’t look at Enzan’s face. He watched the blood trickle down the line and drop into the vial. ]

 ijuinenzan
“-!!” Enzan’s vision blurred for a moment, when the needle went in. He was sure Regal pressed so hard on purpose. He inhaled quickly, and his expression only soured. Regal was touted as being one of the most professional men here, if not a bit naive. So, why was he being so rough?!

The nerves were steadily being replaced by anger. He didn’t want to be here. He wanted to just get on with it, and get Blues, and get back to work- 

His blue eyes remained glued to the ceiling. Still hiding behind a mask, but this time one of displeasure.</span>

“ Please move to the next procedure– you know where. “

[ The vial was set aside, and Regal took to busying himself with a clipboard and various charts. ]

 ijuinenzan
Enzan sat up on the table, rubbing his arm as he went. That was going to smart for days. As he planted his feet on the ground, he felt a bit of dizziness rush his head. He closed his eyes for a second, shaking off the spell. 

Stood up too fast, he thought. 

He shuffled over to the scanner platform, and sat down. Another wave hit him. That couldn’t be from all the movement- he had been drinking enough water, hadn’t he? 

“I- I don’t feel right.” His hand went to his temple, and he slowly laid down.</span>

[ Regal pretended to look busy. His eye focused on the board in his hands, but in his peripheral vision he saw Enzan stagger. It was quite the task to bite a smile back; a grin. Knowing what was happening…Knowing what was to come. His skin was a flame with excitement– soon, soon. ]

[ Slowly Enzan lowered himself into the unit, and Regal strode over. His gait had changed; something about him different. He looked at Enzan; a flicker in his eye. He knew. ]

“ That is normal. ” [ He replied, the glass beginning to close around him. ] “ I have drugged you with a heavy sedative, after-all. ”

[ The glass closed, and Regal allowed himself to grin. ]

 ijuinenzan
Enzan could actively feel all of the blood drain from his head. A cold terror washed over him, increasing the dizzying nausea ten-fold. He was suddenly swimming through tar. Lifting his hand was initially fueled by fear- but… did he even reach the glass?

He tried for a scowl. His arm fell, heavy against his side… His mouth opened…and it closed. The glass fogged slightly, above his mouth, where his shallow breathing ghosted.

Bastard. BASTARD, Enzan thought. Regal was killing him. No matter how hard he swam against this.

His vision stopped providing him with true information even before his eyelids shut. No thoughts…only the cool blackness that dragged him down…it was, in a way, a mercy. For now, he could be free of that grin…free of the terror and anticipation of things to come.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">[ Regal let out a breath; a breath he had held for much too long. It was now that he felt alive, truly alive. ]

[ When Enzan awoke, Regal was watching. He was a mere few feet away; sitting at a table, humbly drinking tea. They were upon a train-car, the lights low and windows blacked out. It was impossible to know the time, how much time had passed since the examination– the kidnapping. ]

[ He had placed Enzan in a seat that faced him; and bound him very tightly with a thick, heavy rope. ]

“ Good morning, “ [ He said, folding one leg over the other. ] “ I trust you slept well. .And now you are very comfortable. “

 ijuinenzan
Enzan inhaled sharply when a jostle of the train jerked him awake. 

He first movement was his hand, fingers curling and wrist twisting against the rope. Pins and needles ran through is arms, and he let out a small sound of complaint. 

Blue eyes opened slightly, hazily running over their surroundings. He locked in on Regal, and his heart began pounding so hard he could barely breath. 

“…Re-gal….” His tongue was heavy, still leaden with drugs. His arms slowly pulled at the ropes, either hoping not to make his struggle obvious, or being too hazy to actually understand the danger he was in. It felt like a dream (The first of many, he was sure he would discover.) . A nightmare from long ago.</span>

“ The sedative will wear off soon. I apologize for using such a heavy dose; but you needed your rest. ”

[ He spoke professionally, voice teetering on the edge of a doctor’s and his own. He looked at Enzan with an amount of detachment– the true nature of what was transpiring had yet to sink in. Regal waited until then to pounce. ]

“ Do you like it ? ” [ He waved a hand at their surroundings. ] “ It is suitable to your tastes, isn’t it ? High class. ”

 ijuinenzan
“B..lues…” Enzan mumbled to himself, blinking away the sticky blackness. Was he going to get help? Would anyone recognize that Regal had done this? He kept his eyes on the doctor, as they narrowed into sharp defiance.

He’d known Regal was evil. He’d known he was an actor. But he was a damn good one.

“What’s….the grand scheme..this time?” Enzans wrist continued to twist, but there was no give; he only chafed himself. His strong front had come up almost seamlessly, blending his tiredness and bravado.</span>

Someone at Scilabs knew. Blues knew; Blues was likely rushing from building to building, searching for his lost family. ]

[ Regal smiled at the thought. ]

“ There is no scheme. ”

[ He placed the words simply. ]

“ As far as anyone knows at Scilabs. .Doctor Hikari examined you. I was not there. And you have simply. .Been misplaced. I may have plans for you, however. . ”

“ I simply wish to break you. Nothing more, nothing less. ”

 ijuinenzan
Enzan exhaled slightly, his stomach dropping in time with the smile’s arrival. His vision began to blur. Examination…he’d been feeling fuzzy at his exam…Regal had drugged him…

He blinked a few times, his defiance turned to a slight wince. 

“Tch- good luck with that. You know how many times I’ve heard that?” Don’t goad him…his mind screamed against the brave front he put up. 

This was Regal. Doctor Regal. He was dizzy just considering the memories this man had given him.

[ He rose from his seat, hand coming from his pocket; there was a cloth in his hand. Cut into ribbon shape, the texture was similar to that of velvet. It was almost too soft for the doctor’s style. He approached Enzan– the car swayed, but he remained still. ]

“ I plan to meet you there. “

[ He grabbed a fistful of Enzan’s hair, forcing the boy’s head down as he swiftly pulled a gag around his mouth. It was tight; impossibly so– it would end up forcing Enzan’s mouth open. ]

 ijuinenzan
Enzan’s gaze remained steady, returning to anger and defiance. The movement of the car made his chair rock. Regal’s steps closer were watched carefully.

He scowled.

“That’s the only place your company would be desir- aaH!” He winced, the train’s jostling only increased the shock. “Ggh-” He tried to turn his head, or twist away, but the deed was already done. 

“Mm-mph!” His yanking at the bonds around him increased, growing a tad more insistent, along with the heated anger in his eyes.</span>

“ Backtalk is quite unbecoming of you, Enzan. “ [ He said, and made the swift motion again. The sound was loud and resounding in the car. ]

“ I’ll have to punish you for that. “ [ His hand dropped down to the binds around Enzan, giving them a sharp tug to assure he was bound tightly. ]

 ijuinenzan
“Hhgk-” Enzan blinked, dazed by the attack. “NHG-!” A splitting headache came on. He probably had a concussion. The metal of the chair vibrated, and stars appeared in his eyes. 

“Gg-h-” His head hung, and he blinked against the pain. 

The ropes cut at his limbs, making the pins and needles start to fade. He could barely move his fingers, and he certainly couldn’t feel his feet. 

“Hhgg-” He tried to speak up in protest, but his head was throbbing so hard he couldn’t even try to fight the muffle over his mouth.</span>

[ Perhaps, though, not for long. ]

[ Returning to his seat, he folded one leg over the other again and rested his chin against joined together fingers. There was silence. Only the movement of the car, the sound of rusted rails against newer wheels– grinding, whining, rejecting one another. ]

“ I am under the impression you are seeing Searchman’s operator. “ [ He placed it bluntly, simply. ] “ That’s interesting. How do you suppose you will manage– a poor soldier with the richest son in all of Electopia? It would be a shame if someone leaked any precious information. “

[ From his coat, he pulled what looked to be photographs. Enzan, Laika, they both were in them. In what could have been a private setting seemed to not be– Somehow, someway, Regal had evidence of their relationship. ]

“ It could get your dear soldier discharged, I believe. Ohh. .that father of yours, too– Perhaps he’d like to hear of this from an anonymous tip. Of course, not before the media does. “</span>

Enzan’s chin hit his chest, and he remained immobile in the silence. It would have seemed he had passed out, if it weren’t for his struggle to keep his eyes open. All of the subtle sounds seemed like an overwhelming timpani section, rattling and pounding over his head. 

The first words take a moment to process. It was so out of place. That was another world, another life. That had nothing to do with this. It was impossible for Regal to know about any of that. 

His head came back up, eyes squinting, glaring painfully. 

Blue eyes rolled over images of them… in his office, asleep on the couch, ice skating, falling over each other- their kiss, at new years. Laika Laika Laika…. His name drummed over and over again in Enzan’s head, as his eyes grew wider and wider with each picture. 

“Mgh- MmnnNGH!” Enzan pulled at his bonds, causing his chair to shift, and his head to feel like it was splitting. 

No, no, leave him out of this, please. Regal couldn’t know about him. He couldn’t have more reasons to target and hurt Laika. Laika was just recovering, he couldn’t go near him- The other threats disappeared. All he could consider was Laika’s safety.</span>

“ I could kill him. “

[ Regal said it simply, because it was just as simple as that. He would simply kill the soldier. Ohh, but that of course was not enough. ]

“ I could force you to kill him. Or, I could gut him. I could torture him for weeks and make him ask for death. Would you like that, Enzan ? “

[ There was no emotion in his expression; his eyes locked with the fury in Enzan’s, the ice cooling it back down. ]

“ If you don’t cooperate with me. .I may have to go through with that. “

 ijuinenzan
Enzan choked, his protests cutting off. His eyes remained wide, a pit of dizzying dread filling is chest, his head. It numbed the pain of the headache, with a drug much much worse. 

As Regal continued, Enzan began to shake. His vision blurred. 

“Nnhh-” His head shook, his voice reducing to a sort of mournful wail. He shrunk in on himself, all of the threats piled in his mind. There was no right answer here, but he had to protect Laika. 

The boy fell back in his seat, blankly looking up at Regal. He pushed back any sort of reaction, or any sort of defiance. Inside was a void of fear and grief, and outwardly there was nothing.

“ If you cooperate, I will burn the photographs. The soldier will not be harmed in any way. “

[ What reason did Enzan have to believe this man– trick after trick he played Enzan like an instrument he was born to master– what reasons could possibly drive him to even listen ? ]

[ The answer was put simply: he cared far too much. ]

[ And the walls slowly returned to their former form, but Regal saw the cracks. ]

“ If you do not, he will be killed. And you know. .as well as any other, that I treat my guests with the utmost care. “

 ijuinenzan
Enzan stared blankly. What could have been his mask was instead an empty, dead expression. Acceptance was crawling over his mind, piecing and stitching the porciline mask back into place. No longer ice or steel, he was fragile as glass.

“I won’t fight.” He finally said, biting around the gag. His closed down throat let out raspy words, like he was drowning in ashes. “That’s what you want me to say.”

The mask cracked and cracked, pieces falling away with each word. He couldn’t keep his defeat hidden. Fear, at least kept away the tears.

He knew Regal wasn’t speaking a word of truth. He knew complying made no difference in what Regal chose to do. He knew all of these things…but there was no choice. As long as that sliver of hope was presented, he had to take the bait.

“ That is exactly what I wished to hear. “

[ A hand reached out, resting on Enzan’s cheek and tipping his head up, just slightly. It was a false hand under that glove, the close proximity and gentle. .Odd, movement of his thumb across Enzan’s cheek creating a whirring noise. He had lost that hand ages ago, and the metal it now was could be felt pressing, against Enzan’s soft skin. ]

“ Hm. .I thank you for complying with me. “

[ Leaning down, close, beside his ear he whispered– ]

“ It’s a shame he’s in the next car. “

[ A syringe was produced from seemingly his sleeve, and into Enzan’s neck it went. ]

 ijuinenzan
Enzan’s eyes flicked instinctively from side to side, as the monster before him rose to its feet. As if something there could help him, set him free or protect him.

His breath caught, and even as his frightened body shook, his expression remained defeated. His eyebrow twitched just a bit, despair breaking down his mask further.

Too close. He was in so much danger. Regal wouldn’t have come over just to make him uncomfortable. There had to be a reason, but he couldn’t fight.

“Nhh-!” Enzan’s eyes went wide again, life forced back into them. His head jerked to the side, and he bucked in the chair. It rattled around slightly, but his fight had no impact on the inevitable.

“Nnnnggh!!! MPPHH!!!” He couldn’t even articulate Laika’s name. The fine control he had used before to talk around the gag in hushed tones was gone. All there was now was a cry of despair. That tar returned to drag Enzan into its depths, but this time he couldn’t even fight. He just sunk, vision blurring. His voice continued to wail, disconnected with his mind. It died to a mere mumble soon, as even Regal’s invasion of space faded to blackness.</span>

A place to test, and work, without the ethical restraints of Scilabs. There were rooms upon rooms, however regal only needed two, this time. A simple office…and a cell. ]

[ He dumped Enzan in the cell(after toting him about in a large suitcase like bag), pulling his limp arms into chains attached to the nearby wall. Otherwise barbaric, the chains were actually very shiny and new. He wanted Enzan restrained…But not comfortably.  ]

[ He waited for Enzan to wake; readying the tests he wished to preform. Once he found the boy starting to stir, he entered the cell again. ]

“ Good Morning, Enzan. Have you slept well ? “

The boy took a long time to wake up. His rough treatment was no match for the drugs Regal had given him. 

Small sounds of the chains shifting and grinding against each other could be heard before he even appeared to be moving. His head remained bowed as he processed the lack of feeling in his hands. He tried to move a finger, and sparkles of pain skittered around from the lack of blood. 

The sound of the familiar voice made him raise his head. He was still too weak to move his limbs, but bleary eyes glanced over the room. 

“R-regal…” His voice was a mere breath. The presence of the doctor made Enzan’s struggle to move revitalize. Unfortunately, supporting his own weight seemed to be too much for him, so he was left to dangle, without even the luxury of his knees touching the ground to support him.</span>

He looked at Enzan as if he were a thing, an object in which Regal was to manipulate. And manipulate he would. The Enzan that had entered that room in Scilabs would never be again. ]

“ It’s been a few days. Your name is in the news again. I’m sure that isn’t strange for you, though. “

[ He flicked the needle of a syringe in his hand. ] “ Your father had to be told to pay for a search party. Isn’t that a shame. Too bad they won’t find you. “

[ His voice had no inflection; he sounded robotic as he relayed the information. ]

“ It’s already been a week, after all. “ [ He approached, intent on giving Enzan the drug in his hand– the murky, dark liquid that screamed danger. ]

A thin sliver of hope dangled in front of Enzan as Regal spoke. People knew he was missing. Surely that meant people would figure out he had been alone with Regal right before his disappearance. Surely, the netpolice would be competent enough. 

Only if his father kept up the efforts. He couldn’t think of even Kifiune, who also had the ability. He’d probably been the one to tell Shuuseki. 

A week, a few days… how could it have been that long? Were either of those time-frames real, or was Regal just trying to distort his reality? 

“Ahh-” He blinked, trying to focus on the syringe. “Tha’ss… what you get for…taaking a celebrity.” The words tumbled out- an attempt at his normal facade. His head reared back, and his body strained a bit against the metal. He was anything but what he was trying to portray. His weakened state made him a poor actor.</span>

[ Regal approached. He flicked the needle again, twice more before steadying a hand on Enzan’s head and keeping it in its tilted back position. There was a pause– not hesitation, it was observation. Enzan’s neck was littered with spots where Regal had stuck a needle much like this one. Perhaps the spotlight would be on his new found hobby rather than the cry of torture. Yes. It would fall on deaf ears. . ]

This was suddenly familiar, and the threat of the needle made his body shake. He breathed slowly, an odd calm washing over him.

“Ah-h…” The slight prick, and cool liquid flowing over him made his whole expression go vacant. His breathing became more shallow. A heat began to build wherever the drug flowed, until his head was pounding, and his vision blurred. His hand shifted against his bonds, making the chains grind against each other again. 

“Ss-t..hh..” His eyelids drooped, unable to yet muster the energy to be afraid. 

[ Images of what seemed like broken mirrors flowed over Enzan’s vision– those of a friend, a father, an enemy, all wrapped into one. And they suffocated, they were all encompassing and LOUD. Louder than any devil, any tempting demon could hope to be– because they did not need to tempt, no, they already had him. ]

[ Regal took a step back, but his once echoing footfalls fell on deaf ears. He knew– first hand, mind– what this could do, the power it held. He was almost swelling with pride at the effects; but he would not allow that yet. He would wait to probe Enzan for answers, for evidence of his experience. ]

[ Voices swam in the room, almost muddled through molasses they crawled, and bit at Enzan with their teeth made of broken glass.  Biting through his flesh and down into the meat of his soul they tasted his blood and wanted MORE. And then the whispers came. ]

“NO- NO— GGRRAH!!!!” His head rose, his back arching. The voices– they still claimed his mind. He could not block them out with sound or pain.

[ It crept into Enzan like a slow, slithering snake hissing and biting into his flesh. While the venom leaked in it shook its rattlesnake tail and rang a siren’s song; soft tones growing LOUDER AND LOUDER, tempting the only one who could hear into absolute terror. Images were sharp, and they sliced and sliced away; intent to fray the last of Enzan’s sanity. ]

[ It was systematic the way it worked. It’s original intention, of course, was pure in a way. It was meant to help people; help people face the deepest of fears, the locked away memories shielded only to protect. HA.

[ Regal stepped forward, and in a fluid motion lifted Enzan off the ground. He held him in such a way that he could not move(if he even could), and was forced to look up, up at the devils flooding from his own soul. His back was to Regal’s chest. ]

“ What are you seeing, Enzan ? “ [ His voice was idle. He sounded like a kind, caring doctor. ]

[ He was anything but. ]</span>

“Bl-ues- hel p me-” His whimpers were broken up from Regal’s splayed hand, keeping him in place. The phantoms twisted together in front of him, forming the flaming demon from his nightmares. Purple fire licked at his fingers as he reached for Blues’ voice.&#160;

He choked, started to sob. He didn’t say anything about the miasma of dark aura. The good doctor would be all to please to see first hand the psychological damage his own creation had on Enzan after all these years later.

“Stop, stop…go away- I’m sorry-”&#160;

A shadow appeared to break through the dark aura, stalking towards him. The Dark Blues at his neck had revealed himself. He broke through the darkness, approaching. Always approaching.

“Blues, Blu-es, I’m sorr-y-” He blubbered on, clawing at Regal’s hand. “I want to go home, please-”</span>

A thin scalpel was produced, &quot;Emergency surgery may be in order...&quot;
The cold metal acted as a sword then, the heat so hot it was searing, ice cold over Enzan&#39;s skin...
The cut was slow and methodical, blood blooming over the cut as red roses, dripping down his neck- Regal&#39;s hand drifted off of restraining Enzan and touched the blood, smearing it on his skin.
It was deep enough not to kill, but to certainly scar. He tucked the scalpel away, and pushed Enzan to the concrete. 
&quot;Perhaps you&#39;ll be a better subject after a moment&#39;s rest.&quot; He mused, and his footsteps followed him out of the room.</span>

The blaring pain flashed through his conscience, and was almost a relief from the voices. 

&quot;Ghhu--&quot; he crawled a half inch. Flashes of the determination that had gotten him this far appeared, and a glance of hatred contorted his figures. Clarity was fleeting. Enzan longed for anger, instead of fear.</span>

Sparks of light danced across Enzan&#39;s face as something drove through the copyroid&#39;s chest. A thick blade pierced the metal, causing the bot to drop Enzan. 
&quot;You spoke too much,&quot; Regal warned, steadying the swaying bot. 
&quot;I- hhrg- I did- as you <em>asked!</em> &quot; The blade came out, then in again. Another cry, and the copyroid lost Blues&#39; form. Regal tossed it away.

Wide eyes remained so, as his body thudded against concrete. Sprained wrist, definite concussion, and so much (he now realized it was dry) <em>blood</em>. 

Three seconds, Enzan couldn&#39;t breath. That was long enough for the copyroid to be tossed in front of him. Just as dead as he was about to be. Enzan reached for it, clawed at the broken robot. His fingers curled around its arm. The thing was dragged along behind Enzan, given all his focus. 

The dead copyroid was the only other presence aside from Regal he had seen in days. His dying companion, he was sure.

He would not be in Regal&#39;s sight for mourning. Not something this intimate and strained.</span>

--
It had gone quiet for a while. Regal had been in and out taking various samples from Enzan- mostly his blood- but the rest was quiet. No more drugging, no more cutting and no more visitors. The silence was deafening, quiet, and all too frightening. Except...the crackle, that permeated the speakers in the corners of the room.
Eventually, a voice came. 
&quot;E...E..nzan? En...zan,&quot; Rockman? His voice was a raw whisper. &quot;Enz..aahn, if you can hear me p-please say so- so- so- somethin&#39;, I can&#39;t s-see.&quot;</span>

&quot;R-ock-? Rockman?&quot; His own voice sounded unfamiliar after days of unuse. Enzan croaked with dehydration. &quot;I can hear you. Are you real? Where are you?&quot; 

No excitement or hope leaped out. Enzan had no illusions that this was really something good.</span>

Being stuck with his own thoughts here was torture enough to seek out the familiar voice. He&#39;d heard him, over and over. Blues&#39; words still resonated with him, trick or not. He found himself not caring. 

The only thing he felt, was slight disgust at hearing his own desperate cries coming from Rockman&#39;s mouth. They felt stale on his own tongue, useless.

&quot;Is there a computer linked to here? Can you do anything?&quot; Enzan&#39;s voice petered out. He looked down at the copyroid, and the bits he had tried to repair. &quot;I have a-a copyroid in my room. There&#39;s nothing else. Can you come here?&quot;</span>

He wanted to puke.

Right. He turned and ran down the hall. Running! What was running to atrophied muscles? He wanted to cry from the power he felt. Selfish thoughts ran through his head, but he used ancient thoughts of control to focus on his escape. Rescue and escape. 

He turned into the room Rockman instructed. Enzan grabbed the door and <em>opened</em> it. A set of computers were there, and a desk. The room was littered with tools and monitoring stations. A little bit of truth, finally.</span>

&quot;Knives. He&#39;s-- he&#39;s got to have them in here.&quot; He closed that drawer quickly and moved on. More papers. A drawer of beakers and electronic parts. A black case at the bottom that held a camera setup. Files on all the agents that had fought Nebula. His <em>team</em>. He prayed they were not here with him. 

Finally, something. A walking stick, with an ornate end to it. It looked like something Enzan&#39;s father would carry. And if it was... Enzan slid off the jewled cover, and a sword was hidden within. 

&quot;I have one. I will.&quot; He rocked on his feet. Still no key. Could Regal have brought it with him? Enzan needed a smaller weapon. He felt under the desk lip, and looked around at the cases. Something he could hide. He clawed through them with raw hands. He wasn&#39;t sure he could hide evidence he&#39;d been here. 

&quot;I&#39;ll. Bring it to my cell. And when he comes. I&#39;ll kill him.&quot; His upperbody rocked now. He was so scared, but finally some <em>hope</em>. &quot;I can&#39;t find the key.&quot;</span>

The plan was rocky, but he hoped it would work out. <em>I&#39;ll keep you safe. Make sure you don&#39;t get hurt anymore. I won&#39;t let him.</em></span>

He grabbed a PET from atop the desk. &quot;There&#39;s no signal down here. But... I could encrypt an outgoing message, if-- if this fails. He&#39;ll leave with this PET eventally, and the message will send when it has signal.&quot; 

He pocketed the PET and quickly rummaged through anything else in the room. IV drips, gasoline, murky liquids of different colors-- 

&quot;There&#39;s nothing else helpful. This is it.&quot; Enzan took the cane and hugged it close to his chest. &quot;I&#39;ll... hide in a doorway. You know the layout best.&quot;</span>

&quot;Okay.&quot; Enzan figured next door was as good as anywhere. Regal would probably come in to check on him from here first. Unless Enzan was overestimating his importance in all this. He held onto the idea that there was some larger plan in this. Saving himself was saving others and he shouldn&#39;t just keel over and--

Enzan rushed out, and into the next room over. The computer Rockman was in. &quot;There are two computers. One is research. Yours has... programming. Another navi?&quot; He thought he recognized some of the work.</span>

Regal walked down the hallway, stopping a moment at Enzan&#39;s cell door. 
It was slightly ajar. 
He almost looked impressed by the feat. A few steps more...
Mechanical hand shot out and grabbed Enzan by the neck.

He dropped the sheath of the sword, but held tight to the weapon. He dragged it upward, slashing into Regal&#39;s arm. He winced, fighting for breath. Metal pushed into his newly scabbed over wound and crushed his windpipe. The sword was used instinctively, pushing the metal at any soft spot he could.</span>

Regal winced from the slash, but didn&#39;t miss a beat. His opposite hand came out and caught the blade, blood blooming over his sliced gloves and staining the white.
&quot;Your father is a forgetful man,&quot; Regal pressed in, attempting to tear the sword from Enzan&#39;s hands. &quot;Left this <em>here.</em> You carry it like he does. <em>Agressively.</em> &quot;
A push, forcing Enzan into the room.</span>

Enzan collapsed. His hand rose to his torn throat. Loud wheezes for breath were all he could manage. 

Rockman&#39;s synchro felt distant. Enzan wanted to keep it-- he crawled towards the door with the last of Rockman&#39;s energy. He broke out into the hallway, and didn&#39;t have the strength to keep moving.
