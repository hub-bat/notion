                    <span class="markdown">Something had gone wrong.
Something had been terribly, overtly wrong for a month or two now- Rockman knew that now. What with Blues unable to see him, unable to calm this rush in his mind it grew, louder and louder. And it wasn&#39;t as if he could articulate it to anyone else- it was only understandable at the base level, down to his soul. Overwhelming thoughts and voices and some plague upon him. The sickness grew deeper. His body weaker. He slept more, waiting. Where had Laika gone again? Missing? 
Rockman felt missing, in some way. He had been, hadn&#39;t he? His memories were fuzzy. Maybe the NetPolice were right, and his testimony was false. Maybe this never happened, and his body was finally rejecting that soul, some errant memory-
Tired eyes blinked at some warning on his visor. He needed to sleep? <em>Yeah, okay...</em>
He did feel tired. More so now that he was aware of it. Slowly he rested down on the floor of his PET, waiting- waiting still for...something. His system said rescue. Rescue from what?
A crackle. The world plunged into darkness.

                    <span class="markdown">Blues sat in meditation in the hospital&#39;s comp system. Anxiety had been swarming over him in waves, thanks to Rockman&#39;s silence. Ever since they had returned from the island, silence. And maybe even for longer-- they had not communicated during the search for Laika. 

It pained him. Blues knew they needed each other right now, but Rockman had isolated himself. 

The email was received in Blues&#39; top priority inbox, along with several communiques with Ijuuin Shuuseki. Fear jolted him to his feet. Why this? After weeks of silence? Blues immediately knew his fears had been realized. 

&quot;Enzan-sama. I need to go to Rockman. I need to go!&quot; 

Enzan&#39;s head jerked up, startled. &quot;Blues?&quot;</span>

Its voice was not fully realized yet, so it jumped and hissed and crackled. The body had stood and begun to pace, begun to shed armor from this body. Speckles of healing wounds turned black and wept, as bloody hands messed with them. 
Face mangled, it had turned into a bouncing waveform with vacant eyes filled with static. It did not see like Rockman saw; it was no longer Rockman. 
&quot;P47H3T1C 7H1NG...&quot; A hiss and growl. A deep slash down its arm- it dripped down its fingertips. A thrust of the hand- and the locks on the doors were corrupted until they no longer functioned.

&quot;Go... go. It&#39;s alright.&quot; Enzan smiled weakly, &quot;make sure he&#39;s alright.&quot; Finally seeing Rock was important. Both men missed him dearly. 

Blues raced through the warp, and all the way to Rockman&#39;s homepage. He knew he would be first to respond to the hail. No one else was as fast. He sent a quick message to Searchman that he would investigate-- there was no need for both of them to leave the hospital. 

Blues slashed open the corrupted doors, anticipating danger the more he saw. 

&quot;Rockman? Rock!&quot; The sight was <em>disturbing</em>. A falsification of Rockman&#39;s body was here. Blues summoned a sword, &quot;Rockman, what has happened?&quot;</span>

&quot;What-- have you <em>done?!</em>&quot; His shoulders wrenched, but he barely moved. 

There was a glowing-- that moment of warmth, and joining. But now... he just felt cold. Like his very S0UL had been taken away. There was a crawling feeling, a rumbling anger that resonated with the stone around him. 

He had been here before. Maybe in a dream.</span>

Small, yet burning blue eyes stood behind Savior, lunging the sword into its chest- the containment was over, it was time to KILL. The wielder held their shaky defense. Enzan- or some figment of him, different from the previous one. 
<em>Fight, Blues! This is child&#39;s play!</em>

Those words made sense, even if the images didn&#39;t. Blues tried to feel his arms, or legs. The function to activate his sword was used. He felt a crack by his feet, and the rumbling warmth of anger flush down his sword arm. A start at freedom, at least. The weapon hummed under the rock. Like eggshells, it fell away from his arm. 

Suddenly, this scenario didn&#39;t seem all that familiar. Disconnecting this scene from his nightmares made the rest of the rock fall away. 

&quot;Rockman--&quot; Blues descended on Rock&#39;s frame while Savior was distracted. He slammed his sword down onto the chains, and then leaped back into the monster. He carved his sword up its back.</span>

The black sludge dripped from his fingers and faded into the ocean.
Another form stood on the shore. Calling his name, but no sound- they were barely even seen over the heat daze of some summer day.</span>

Even Blues&#39; visor wasn&#39;t enough to block the blinding sun. He crawled through the sand and water. Blues felt like his voice was gone, just the same as the distant image. 

A memory data sprung to Blues. Enzan said he had dreams like this, where moving and speaking was all muted like cotton, and control drifted away with his mind. Blues tried to focus harder on the image in the sand.</span>

A rush of A/C followed the door&#39;s opening. The hospital was eerily empty, but clean and well maintained. The only sound that was heard was a soft heart monitor, which was beginning to slow...Each beat taking longer than the last.
The spectre whirled around and faced Blues again. 
[DO]
[NOT]
[LOOK]
They reached out and touched again. Again, that murk bubbled over their fingers. Intensity was a feeling, a push.

Perhaps it was a trick. He pushed past the specter and shoved it aside to walk deeper into the hospital.</span>

[HERE!!!]
The spectre disappeared with a huff. 
-
The final door at the end of the hallway was left slightly ajar. It had felt like ages had passed in walking here. Had it? Blues wouldn&#39;t be able to tell. 
What Blues didn&#39;t understand about Soul Union was made very clear- they had never, ever been alone here. 
Inside the room was Rockman, sitting up in the bed. He appeared less like a navi and more, soft. Human. Various devices were attached to his skin- most vital to his function. 
He appeared just as empty as when Savior was tossing him about. The heart monitor played a failing tone. He was dying.</span>

He refused to believe what he saw. 

&quot;Rockman, you can do it! One virus cannot bring you down--&quot; Blues brought one hand down to Rock&#39;s chest. A heartbeat. Hub.bat had to be somewhere in here. Fear made Blues&#39; hands shake.

How had Rockman&#39;s mindscape deteriorated so far? It hadn&#39;t been this long, had it? Blues had been neglecting his duties. Guilty...</span>

In the reflection of Rockman&#39;s wide eyes, the figure looming at his bedside was not Blues, but a darker, more sinister form of him. &quot;G-Get a-away!!! I&#39;ve h-hhuurt- &#39;nough- hrk-&quot; 
He moved to shuffle out of the bed, trying to get away from Blues. Wires and equipment tugged painfully at his skin. 
The spectre reappeared. Rockman didn&#39;t acknowledge.

Blues tried to ignore the specter. He didn&#39;t need this, the patronizing tone... he needed Rock to see him! It was so tempting to lash out at the specter, that seemed to know <em>something</em> it would not foreclose. 

This was not how this should happen! How could he convince Rock it was <em>him</em> and not... 

Blues paused. He listened to the anger urging him to snap at the specter. He looked at his hands. Purple armor protruded along his forearms. Blues&#39; chest grew colder.</span>

The spectre advanced on Blues, the touch from before instead burning, deep from fingertips to false flesh. Rockman was left behind in a flash, as it dragged Blues out into a dark hallway. 
It had more features this time. Both eyes, a mouth. And anger- deep, deep anger. 
&quot;You are tainted, DarkSoul!&quot; The spectre threw Blues to the far wall. The door to Rockman&#39;s room slammed shut, and clicked with an unseen lock. 
&quot;I will eject you from this place,&quot; a flick of the wrist, a VarSword protruding. &quot;I will not allow harm to come to him! You did not heed my prior warnings- you face the consequences now!&quot; 
While still simple, the voice the spectre had was booming, full. It was Blues&#39;- as if suddenly it had gained back something it had lost.</span>

The sword grazed up from Blues&#39; waist up to the center of his stomach. Blues groaned, but kept up his defenses. Cold seeped down into his limbs-- even the anger that should have gone along with such a wreched form was hard to find. 

&quot;I will not fail! I will not deceive! I will <em>protect him!</em>&quot; That final thought urged Blues to surge up and forward. His sword kept locked in with his enemy&#39;s. He shoved the imposter against the cold concrete wall on the other side of the alley.</span>

What next came into view, was memory. This time, wholely Blues&#39;- as if experiencing it all over again. Control was wrenched from Blues&#39; limbs as he played out the memory again, as if a doll. 
Parting breath, separating from kiss, <em>I love you.</em> 
And the reply like lye: <em>I love you too.</em>
The copy, the fake. Fluttering eyes and smile on his face fake, fake- there was no warmth in this <em>shell.</em>
<em>What will you do, then?</em> Unidentifiable voice. Control returned. The copy laid against him just as it had before.</span>

&quot;I protect Enzan from you. Rockman as well. They do not need to see-- and they accept these aspects of me, regardless.&quot; Blues said it, but he wasn&#39;t sure. Wasn&#39;t it his worry, that if he told them all how <em>much</em> he desperately wanted to kill Regal-- how <em>willing</em> he had been to save Enzan and <em>leave</em> Laika to die--? He would surely be abandoned. A navi that so strictly adhered to his code like that, to the point of erasing his own identity... he wasn&#39;t sure what traits were more desired. He wasn&#39;t sure of anything. 

And in this space, all of those thoughts could surely be felt. His navi symbol was grey.</span>

A sudden shift, the wind picked up and whistled through the broken windows. Dark Blues&#39; hand flicked out to the side, and a far wall crumbled away. This was familiar, something that Savior could not have ever accessed...Yet...
&quot;A part of you you&#39;ve missed.&quot; The beast growled, hungry, at the darkloid&#39;s side. The young boy was there, innocent and wide eyed and far from these terrors.</span>

He could suddenly remember the moment like it was yesterday, after years of blank space in that moment. 

He said... &quot;I am Blues. I will be your netnavi. Happy to meet you, Enzan-sama. If you need anything at all, please ask me.&quot; 

&quot;You can&#39;t have this. You destroyed it.&quot; Blues&#39; voice was a whisper as he broke from the memory to look at Dark Blues.</span>

The energy of this shadow swirled around Blues, and closed in on his navi symbol. Parts of him...all parts of him that Rockman had taken during double soul. How had this part of him slipped through the cracks? Blues shouldn&#39;t have underestimated how much was shared. Everything. It was always &quot;we.&quot; 

Blues didn&#39;t want to be selfish. The memory of Enzan&#39;s first meeting with him had been taken during the first dark aura battle. It wouldn&#39;t be right to waste anymore time when he could be saving Rockman. 

Blues let out a deep breath, like Rockman had shown him. He walked past the broken wall, and Enzan&#39;s soft voice. He pushed the door open, and pictured a hospital. It appeared before him, sterile and white. Familiar to them. It wasn&#39;t like where Enzan was staying, it was unique to here. 

Blues couldn&#39;t block out any of his swarming emotions. It was a freeing feeling. Savior had meant it as torture, but he had accepted that he wanted to kill. Rockman had already known-- Enzan-sama, surely had as well. And they had not left him.</span>

Then he worried that his paranoia might hurt Rockman too. Maybe he still had to protect Rockman from himself? In this moment, his strong emotions were a hinderance. 

Blues broke off the double soul. 

It was like tearing off a limb. Blues&#39; visor fragmented as soon as he left, and static filled his head. This time he had been the one taking back injuries from his partner. Inhuries Savior had instigated crackled up Blues&#39;s arms and legs.</span>

A keystroke and he was gone, wisked away to his private, quaratined server. 
Doctor Hikari let out a held breath. Time to get to work, he thought bitterly.
-
Blues had been harder than Rockman to work on, surprisingly. Rockman had many an automated system to keep him functioning, but Blues was more hands on. He had neglected to send a message to Enzan, knowing that he was in the hospital and needed his rest. Though, something told him he was already somewhat aware of the situation...
He attempted a reboot, and it was finally successful. <em>&quot;Good morning, Blues.&quot;</em>
It was technicallg morning- some awful hour in the night by now. <em>&quot;Give me a status report please.&quot;</em></span>

Another keystroke, and he returned Blues&#39; arm to stasis. Admin controls lied with him. 
<em>&quot;He will be left alone until he wakes.&quot;</em> He said slowly, quieter. Measured, as he had to be. <em>&quot;You know better than most it would hurt him more to see you revived than fixed.&quot;</em></span>

He glanced at another monitor. Rockman laid within, in a dreamless sleep, letting Doctor Hikari&#39;s assistants work tirelessly at removing all the residue the monster left behind. 
He picked up his PET again, and sent a message to Enzan requesting the last restore point Blues had. Quick, terse. He had forgotten Enzan&#39;s position and keeping it from him. All he wanted now was quiet- no more talk, just the silence of his office. The only constant he really had.

<em>&quot;Mister Rockman, you must-&quot;</em> came the voice of a clearly distressed assistant, trying to direct Rockman from this server back to his own. Locks hadn&#39;t worked in 15 years- and something had always possesed Doctor Hikari to never change them. Rockman hid behind a pillar, watching the two exchange. All the anger that Doctor Hikari had melted away when he saw him, and he exhaled it all in a weak sigh. <em>&quot;Ro-&quot;</em> -why was he playing appearances in front of Blues?- <em>&quot;...Saito, please go back to your se- room.&quot;</em> 
Rock looked up at his father, inncocent eyes scanning over him, wondering when his fatherhood turned into fear. He did as he was told, and let the assistant take him back. 
Once they were alone again, Doctor Hikari removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. <em>&quot;It&#39;s unfair of me to assume you can handle all of him. You are his...partner. Not his guardian. That role lies with me.&quot;</em> He rolled his chair closer and opened up Blues&#39; filesystem.
