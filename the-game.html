He made Pen give him case information-- he didn&#39;t trust HQ to tell him everything when he was like this. Pen complied, to the risk of her career. She would have risked anything then, to bring Laika home safe. 

Enzan holed himself up in IPC, never venturing out. His office was his intelligence gathering unit. Every navi he had control over was on the case. Every human employee was secretly asked to report on a different hailing frequency, to double check. 

He researched clues, had Blues organize groundwork, and still, there was nothing. For so many sleepless nights, there was nothing. 

A country-wide manhunt was issued, but still. Nothing.</span>

Outreach to Sharo was ineffective, with even the failsafe method of locating Laika failing. Nation Z was even less helpful, going as far as turning the situation around and threatening drastic actions if Regal was not found. Both men had seemed to gone up in smoke, taking their navis and tools with them. 

It wasn&#39;t until a rather obscure tip came in that the case found traction again. However, the NetPolice would be the second to receive it.  One of IPC&#39;s navis had stumbled upon a shortwave radio enthusiast&#39;s board, and their sudden fascination with a new station that was recently discovered. They were mostly in awe of it&#39;s old, age of espionage feel, with it&#39;s prelude being the first two lines of a traditional Sharonian song. 

In further discussion it was dubbed &quot;Lyuli&quot;, and the enthusiasts were trying to figure out it&#39;s purpose and message. After the song were strings of numbers, spoken in a synthesized voice. It would repeat like this, only for a few hours of the day, but those hours were always the same.</span>

He still held his breath until it all made sense. Tears sprung up when he read it fully, but they were not humored. 

&quot;Send out a targeted return message. See if we can make contact with wh-oever is out there.&quot; Enzan&#39;s voice cracked from only using it to bark orders and bouts of long isolation. 

His nightmares hadn&#39;t stopped. If anything, they were worse.

&quot;We&#39;re flying out there. There&#39;s no time to verify. Just keep sending a return message and listen for message changes until we get there.&quot; Enzan hadn&#39;t been a praying man before all this had started. He took quiet moments now, praying to whoever would listen for Laika&#39;s safe return. 

Enzan packed a small bag, similar to the one Pen had given him, and hauled it on up to his helecopter pad. Emergency tools and a couple of weapons were packed. He told no one. 

&quot;Blues, you&#39;re driving.&quot;</span>

The coordinates lead to the north, beyond Japan&#39;s traditional border. It was the one of many islands threaded between them and Sharo. This particular bead had been uninhabited, always. Because of it&#39;s steep cliffs and rough seas, no one thought to take root on it&#39;s shores. It was simply a small place where birds nested, and an ancient volcano laid dormant. 

However, that assumption seemed to be challenged upon aproach. It must have hosted human life at some point, if only for a short while, for seeing the island with ones own eyes revealed a few radio towers clustered near a derelict structure. They teetered near the southernmost edge of the isle, feet away from sliding into the sea.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan had little more to do on the flight over, than worry. The broadcast had not changed since it had first been detected. How long had it been playing before someone heard it? Did the lack of response mean the person that had set it up was no longer around? The sight of the broken down building did nothing to change his speculations. This was a dangerous place. Fragile cliffs was right-- not to mention the barren landscape. How anyone could survive here was beyond him.

&quot;Blues, land as close to the center as you can.&quot; Enzan stood up, slipping on his vest. He rechecked his backpack, and shouldered that as well. Gloves, check. Boots, check. Sweatshirt... check. &quot;And... send Pen the coordinates. We don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll find.&quot; Maybe he could call in one more favor with her, and get a dimensional area raised if trouble hit.</span>

Suddenly, a bright light shot down from the sky, exploding outward just above the island&#39;s peak. What followed was a familiar sight. Translucent hexagonal scales cascaded down, beginning to cover the island in a vibrant colored dome. A dimensional area. It rushed quickly towards the helicopter, ensuring no time for evasion. It&#39;s rutter was clipped, creating a burst of energy that rippled through the rest of the field. 

On the ground, a small gleam of glass reflected off the light. It came from one of the building&#39;s windows. There was a spectator, taking witness to the dazzling and dangerous display in the sky.</span>

The water spiraled closer. Enzan had only seconds to confirm he had Blues. He leapt from the helicopter door, and plunged into the freezing water. 

The boots he had taken such care to lace were  an immediate problem. They couldn&#39;t be ditched as quickly as the backpack, which was already plunging into the depths. Enzan fumbled for his syncro chip, as he plummeted.  A few of his other chips were lost to the water, but he found and inserted it. 

Blues&#39; strength surged around him. His visor shut, just before he was about to run out of air. R Blues used their boosters to launch out of the water, and hover in the air until they were steady enough to boost all the way up the cliff face. They wobbled, and landed a few feet away from the edge. Their waterlogged hair drenched the grass. His visor opened, before he stood up. If there was already an area here, there must be danger he should remain in crossfusion for. 

They scanned the trees nearby. All was quiet here. They decided on the building then. Perhaps it was where Regal had relocated to.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The crashing waves were loud as they smacked the island&#39;s walls, but they were still deafened by the helicopter&#39;s crash nearby. A plume of fire stretched upwards, curling in on itself about a kilometer away from the building. After it&#39;s demise, life on the island grew still. Time seemed to have paused, allowing hues to grow rich against the grey sky. With the dimensional area up, the ocean winds didn&#39;t touch the land. Electric hums threatened to be drowned by the thin crusting of snow along the rocks. 

Amongst these stones were hints of life. Boot treads laid indented into the salt and ice. They had been there for some time, but not long enough to melt away.

Just then, there was a rustle in the trees beyond the cliffs. Nothing so far hinted at there being anything bigger than a bird living on the island. This indicated something far bigger than that.</span>

Their brightly colored ensemble was cartoonish against the grey surroundings, but they kept quiet regardless. Their head jerked as the irregular motion appeared. Carefully, they moved ahead. They were cautious to avoid destroying the tracks, because their hair was still trailing a stream of freezing water. 

R Blues activated his sword, and scanned the trees as he approached the area. Whatever it was didn&#39;t seem natural. In fact, everything around here seemed dead. His speed sloshed up a bit of snow and ice, but he zipped under the first tree, ready for anything.</span>

The noises seemed to circle around the woods, growing louder for a moment before disappearing into where the vegetation grew thick. It was too heavy a sound to be something small, but also too large to be human-sized.

Whatever it was vanished, leaving the visitor alone in the stillness once more. Silence ate away at the calm, leaving a haunting fringe around the scene. Suddenly, something else disrupted the quiet. A voice from the right, further up the trail.

&quot;Enzan...?&quot;</span>

But all that fell away, the second their scanner picked up a human. Their weaponry disabled, and they were <em>running</em>, and in a flash too quick to see, their arms were enveloping <em>Laika</em>. 

&quot;Oh my <em>God</em>.&quot; Any other words were swallowed up by tears. They choked on Laika&#39;s name, and held him. The emotions were so overwhelming, the crossfusion threatened to break.</span>

&quot;E-easy...&quot; He coughed. &quot;But... is it really you?&quot;

His hands rose up through wet hair, as if he was trying to assess the reality of what was in front of him. His touch was light, and he pulled away slightly from R Blues&#39; grasp. 

The slick coat that covered him failed to hide new additions to his face and hands. Red and blacks scabs, painful just by looks. Something had inflicted great harm on him.</span>

It was still him. Different, damaged, but <em>Laika</em>. Not a dream and not a nightmare. 

&quot;I&#39;m here, I&#39;m not gonna leave you again. I&#39;m here.&quot; 

R Blues closed their eyes for a second, letting the tears slow. Blues wanted to get moving, and Enzan wanted to linger. Their cross faltered again. Pixels fluctuated between Laika&#39;s arms. 

&quot;It&#39;s over. It can finally be over.&quot;</span>

He straightened up, and moved out to arms length. Enzan&#39;s words had him look around quickly.

&quot;We have to get back to the building.&quot; Laika&#39;s tone shook as he dabbed away tears. &quot;It isn&#39;t safe. Not with the area up.&quot;</span>

Even if Enzan hadn&#39;t crossed since being taken, clearly he could still do it. The only regularity in his life since this all started had been his training with Blues. His hours of training kept him grounded, reminded him of who he was.

&quot;I swear to god, I won&#39;t let anything else hurt you.&quot; Intensity flared back up. This was his fault, Laika was here. He never would have come to Electopia to begin with if Enzan hadn&#39;t called him.

Blues pushed the desire to <em>protect</em> to keep the cross stable. Enzan shared it, pushing away the guilt for now.</span>

Doubt and fear seemed doubled on his bony features. Laika looked to the building beyond them. Nothing about it looked safer, but it was the only source of shelter that could be determined. Just glancing at it seemed to steady Laika. He didn&#39;t feel flighty.

&quot;Please Enzan. I want to go inside.&quot; He pleaded. A scarce smile came up. &quot;You and Blues can protect me there...&quot;</span>

R Blues shifted their hand to hold Laika&#39;s. Gentle hiccups rocked them. Maybe inside, Enzan could help him do <em>something</em> about those... burns? 

&quot;What--&quot; they couldn&#39;t pick what question was most important right now. &quot;How long have you been here? On this island? How have you been eating?&quot; He could tell it wasn&#39;t <em>well</em>, but Enzan hoped it was at least <em>possible.</em></span>

The path to the building grew more. worn the closer they got. A small trail of muddy snow formed, shooting off several directions. Trails of exploration, but with them, in the snow nearby, large indents of something <em>inhuman</em> were also there.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Laika answered with a sniffle. &quot;Food was here when I came. It&#39;s-- ahah-- it&#39;s gross. Rations. Been trying to find other food. Fish and- birds.&quot;

They came up to the entrance, and Laika opened the door. Just inside on the wall was a rifle, old. From eras long before modern tech like PETs and Dimensional Areas.

&quot;It&#39;s hard to shoot as I am.&quot; He added. &quot;The recoil hurts.&quot;</span>

Blues blocked Enzan from making an apology. Thoughts whirred through Blues&#39; mind so fast, Enzan couldn&#39;t understand them. All Enzan could sense was disconnect with what they were learning. It was too much to take in. They grasped again for something urgent, shared. 

&quot;The dimensional area was down when we arrived. Are the controls local?&quot; Even in his fuzzy state, this was still a mission. No matter how close to his heart, he had to keep moving.  For all his time here, he knew Laika hadn&#39;t been twiddling his thumbs. 

The crossfusion terminated, and Enzan grabbed the PET. He reached up to dab away his own tears. He kept his gaze averted from the barbaric weapon.</span>

He finished and quickly stuffed his hands into the pockets of his coat. A few steps were taken towards the stairs that sat to the side of the building&#39;s entryway. He paused at the questions, and turned back to answer. The tears from before had dried up, but he still had plenty of emotions playing on his face. Eyes pitted by dark circles smile with glee, yet his brow raised in fear. 

&quot;Too big to be hosted here. Comes from the satellite system.&quot; Laika explained. &quot;I can&#39;t cancel it, or control it. It&#39;s automatic. Turns on whenever someone approaches the island. Or if I stay outside for too long.&quot; 

He nodded to upstairs, and took the lead again. There really was nothing of interest on the first level. Most of the windows were blown out, making it just as cold and drab as outside. Doors seemed to be rusted shut, except for one. Laika didn&#39;t linger to give a chance to explore it. He made it to the top of the flight, and grunted in pained effort as he tried to get a door up there open.</span>

Sustaining the cross fusion like that was exhausting... and having their thoughts colliding made it worse. Once they calmed down they could fuse again and fight anything this island threw at them. 

&quot;Hey-- hey, let me do it.&quot; Enzan rushed up to help. He very gently wrapped his arm around Laika&#39;s middle, and used his other arm to force it open. It was stuck pretty good-- Enzan was amazed Laika had used this door before at all. 

The squared off doorways and long stretching halls made Enzan wonder what this building could have been for before this. A hospital? A school? What needed metal doors like this? A prison?

&quot;Uhf-- there.&quot; Finally, it jerked open. He stuck close to Laika, as if he&#39;d disappear if Enzan even looked away.</span>

Inside was a room, with a smaller off to the side. The windows here were mostly intact, thanks to tape or plastic that secured them shut. Laika shut the door behind them, so that the warmth was preserved. There wasn&#39;t very much.

The heat seemed to come from the stacks of electronics that crowded the room. They were bulky and beige with age, but all seemed to be running perfectly. In the middle of it all was a cot with a thin mattress. Various worn blankets were strung about it, ratty and pilled. Some were blotched with small red stains.

&quot;Sorry... it&#39;s not much.&quot; Laika muttered as he walked to sit on the side of the cot. He mustered up a half-smile. &quot;I won&#39;t have to use it anymore though. I&#39;m glad.&quot;</span>

He followed quickly after Laika, hovering inches from him. Enzan teetered between confusion and the desperate need to <em>care</em>. He was falling away from his mission mindset. Given a second to just look at Laika made his body sway.  

&quot;No apologies.&quot; Enzan waved his hand and wondered how much shock Laika had to be in. &quot;God-- we need to get to a hospital. Blues, check on Pen&#39;s progress. Let her know we f-ound him.&quot; 

&quot;Yessir. I am maintaining communica-- I <em>was</em> maintaining communication sir. There is significant feedback now. They are still on their way, but I cannot confirm I am reaching them with more messages.&quot;

His shoulders stiffened, and his eyes ducked back to find Enzan&#39;s. They were dark with fear.

&quot;They need to hurry- he&#39;s <em>coming</em>. He&#39;s figured out you&#39;re here. You&#39;re not welcome.&quot; 

His voice shuddered as he spoke. Laika looked to the offered hand and took it. His touch was ginger, to compensate for the burns, but shaking spelt out fear. They were inside, supposedly safe, yet he was still terrified.</span>

&quot;Who, Laika? Who is it?&quot; Enzan&#39;s voice hushed down as far as he could make it. Urgency flushed his face, as the more heroic parts of him made a come back. His synchro chip was clasped in his free hand. Even if it was a human threat, Enzan knew he was a hellofa lot braver in crossfusion right now. 

&quot;Enzan-sama. We should leave the building.&quot; Blues&#39; voice was harsh in the quiet Enzan had been trying to create. For some reason, Enzan could feel more panic coming from his <em>navi</em> than anywhere else.</span>

&quot;He. There&#39;s a <em>darkloid</em> here.&quot; Laika managed. &quot;He can&#39;t get inside. He c-can&#39;t. It is safest here, please- don&#39;t go.&quot;

His whole presence told of the fact that if Enzan were to go outside, Laika wasn&#39;t going with him. 

The computer around them started to work harder, their fans spinning at max to exhaust hot air. Laika tried to breathe more, turning towards Enzan to focus on him. Spindly fingers fumbled with his coat sleeves. It was oversized, canvasing his smaller frame in failed attempts to look normal. 

He managed to slow his shivers and find more to say. It was &quot;You just came back- I thought- I thought he had taken you away for good. I am so happy you&#39;re here but... I&#39;m sorry- I&#39;m sorry-&quot;</span>

Tell me as much as you can about it, and stay where it&#39;s safe until I delete it.&quot; Enzan moved in front of Laika, looking to keep focus and help him calm down. It not being <em>able</em> to come in the building seemed implausible, but Enzan didn&#39;t want to scare him. Whatever it&#39;s motives were, Enzan had a feeling it was controlling Laika in this trap. 

&quot;None of this is your fault.&quot; Pang after pang of guilt and grief widened in Enzan&#39;s stomach. A month or so of dissociated working was widening and crashing on their heads. Not yet, he urged his body, not until they were home. 

&quot;Enzan-sama, there are consistency errors. We <em>must</em> mo--.&quot; Blues&#39; voice was cut short by Enzan. None of that would help Laika&#39;s rising upset. 

 &quot;I&#39;m here. I&#39;m alive. And I&#39;m going to get us out of here.&quot; His hand was readied by his PET. All of Laika&#39;s conflicting fears made him uncertain where or when the danger would come. &quot;We&#39;ll work together, like we always have. Right? Easy and familiar. We&#39;re a team.&quot;</span>

His fingers reached out and gently grabbed at Enzan&#39;s clothes. A small tug tried to bring him closer, further away from the exit he threatened. Laika swallowed a sob and sniffle, and pressed his head against Enzan&#39;s stomach.

&quot;We&#39;re a team, right.&quot; He stated. &quot;But even so, what&#39;s lurking out there can&#39;t be fought alone. I can&#39;t crossfuse like this. I can&#39;t help you. We need to wait for the backup. Wait for Pen.&quot;</span>

&quot;I--&quot; his voice croaked, threatening to crack the carefully constructed dam around his tears. He swallowed, and the words came out as if spoken through a sheet of glass. &quot;I can fight one darkloid for you. I <em>can</em> do that. Just tell me what you know about it. Even if I wait... we need to know.&quot; 

Enzan&#39;s PET began buzzing madly. He grabbed it, and read what was on the screen. It made him even more shaky. He watched Laika&#39;s head move under him. 

&quot;Searchman&#39;s here? Where is he?&quot; The conditions of the crossfusion... Enzan hadn&#39;t noticed the phrasing, but Blues sure had. If Searchman was here, they might have an edge.</span>

Laika was cut off by the whiff of something fasting moving above him. A trail of light flashed past, pulling a part of Enzan&#39;s hair with it. The sound came next, a puncture of glass followed by the sharp thud of a bullet hitting the wall.

He jolted, delayed. Enzan was dragged to the floor with one quick tug. Laika let out a pained yelped, but didn&#39;t try to remedy how he laid. The cot was cover, the cot was safety.

&quot;E-enzan! Enzan...&quot; Laika&#39;s eyes were wide as he looked at his partner. His grip was the strongest it had been since their reunion. He was clinging for life. He tried to silence himself, but ragged breath and worry made that hard.

&quot;S-staaay... ssh gootta... be quiet.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan was stunned into stillness. His body shook terribly, but he was easily manipulated to the floor. He clung to his PET and synchro chip, but the world spun so hard he&#39;d forgotten how to use them. Slowly, he reached up to make sure he wasn&#39;t bleeding. A heat blister was already forming just under his ear. 

That hadn&#39;t seemed like any Darkloid Enzan had encountered before. He was right in assuming they weren&#39;t safe in here. 

Enzan&#39;s breathing was halted. He tried to calm himself and failed. 

Blues, Blues. PET. Enzan finally pieced together the pieces of what they needed, and slotted in his synchro chip. Light buzzed from their little spot on the ground, and promptly went out. 

Still, Enzan. Laying there. He heaved a gasp, and clutched his chest. &quot;B-blues?&quot;</span>

R Blues wasn&#39;t there. It was still Enzan. Shock sank in quick as Laika grabbed again. He looked to Enzan and nothing else. Not even the bullet lodge in the wall behind them.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; He hushed. &quot;Why didn&#39;t it work? I-it always works...&quot;

This new worry stacked on the fears outside that made themselves known. Something started walking, shutting Laika up. Their stride was cut with metal, clicking as they came closer. With each step a more synthetic noise was heard, revealing it to be the darkloid that just took a shot. 

It all stopped just outside the window, yet Laika wouldn&#39;t dare to look and see. He wouldn&#39;t let Enzan look either, not if his current grip said anything about it.</span>

Enzan kept his eyes stuck on Laika. The amount of perpendicular thought coming from Blues was overwhelming. Enzan couldn&#39;t understand it. He was barely breathing. 

In the utter silence, all there was to do was repress and repress and repress and listen to his own heartbeat. 

His PET flashed different messages as Blues tried to communicate. All muted. All invisible.</span>

The footsteps started again. They were loud as they followed the side of the building for a moment. Then, they turned and started to fade. The clicks of metal melted into the electronic hum of the dimensional area. Soon after, the area dropped. Color vanished from the island, bringing back a world of grey and blue.

Laika broke the returning silence with a gasp. He released Enzan and reared back to cover coughs. The shock of it all disrupted a delicate balance. At the ends of coughs came upset. Laika kept his hand up as he bit back sobs.

&quot;Hhhh...&quot; He shook his head as he looked down at Enzan. Distress was obvious. &quot;C-co... His name is. C... Countershade. Rrregal brought him here. With me. H... He. He took Searchman away.&quot;</span>

He forced a growl, to focus himself. 

&quot;He-- won&#39;t be taking anything <em>else!</em>&quot; Enzan grabbed his PET almost violently. He stared at the flashing information Blues was sifting through. &quot;Minimize! Only the enemy at hand!&quot; 

Blues&#39; information sucked down to techniques based on stealth and long range weapons. Enzan breathed, but his eyes were wild.

&quot;Sorry... Sorry...&quot; Laika heaved. &quot;I wish it wasn&#39;t l-like this. I wish... I wish...&quot;

Further words were cut off by a moment&#39;s sob. It was easily heard now that the computers surrounding them had settled. Enzan&#39;s words barely got through, even in the respite. The sob too was cut off, as Laika cycled through too fast, not allowing himself any kind of relief.

He picked his head up, just enough for two dark, murky eyes to peek out.

&quot;I wi-sh...&quot; He hiccuped. &quot;I had killed him when I ha-d the chance... I regret it so mmuch.&quot;</span>

His paranoia was striking harder than ever. He didn&#39;t want to <em>hurt</em> Laika more by having another breakdown. 

&quot;You&#39;re not a killer. No one can blame you for that.&quot; Enzan had killed before. The thought was too much to process beyond the fact. 

Enzan&#39;s PET buzzed in code. Exit. It chimed, and Enzan squeezed it. The dimensional area was gone, so why did everything still feel so chaotic? The rescue team <em>had</em> to be close now.</span>

He shuddered as the shaky panic evolved into something else. A strange invisible energy rose around him, like the blistering heat that caused the burns shown. Frustration, anger, blossoming from the strangest panic.

&quot;Enzan... he killed me. He was s-so close from taking me away from you. I&#39;m only alive because he willed it.&quot; Laika bit his words like they were challenging his safety. &quot;He needs to know that was a mistake. He gave me a chance. I nee... ngh-&quot;

He lifted his head, revealing more than just tears. Scabs of burns and tramua framed his expression. Pained as it was, there was also rage.

Perfect. Perfect? After this? Enzan knew it was impossible. But when had things ever been perfect? 

&quot;You- you&#39;re <em>not</em> dead. Don&#39;t sa-y that!&quot; Enzan swallowed down his stuttering. Reality wavered. He wanted to be steady! A rock, a rock-- &quot;don&#39;t, don&#39;t--&quot; the wheezing from his throat didn&#39;t feel like it came from himself. 

&quot;I&#39;ll help you. Of course I&#39;ll help you. I&#39;m here to help you. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry--&quot; he hadn&#39;t wanted to sound like he didn&#39;t want to help! Laika had to know Enzan was only dedicated to helping him.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Laika rubbed his eyes, simmering down to sniffles and hiccups after the answer was given. One hand gripped his leg tightly before letting it fall out of the huddled position. He shifted to move closer to Enzan, in the most gentle way he could muster.

&quot;No, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Laika spoke. &quot;I- I got upset. It&#39;s just that all of this is so very... upsetting.&quot;

He reached out, to try and touch. Enzan was so close, yet their words to each other just now made an sizable rift. Laika sought remedy with a touch. A hand to the arm, or maybe the shoulder. Which ever he grabbed, pressure was place to ensure he was steady. His brow knotted in display of the pain that such a measure took to preform.

&quot;Thank you... Thank you. I love you. We&#39;ll succeed, like always.&quot; Laika cycled through encouragments. His grip was shaky the longer he held it. He looked up to catch Enzan&#39;s eyes again. &quot;You&#39;ll h-help so much.&quot;</span>

Enzan&#39;s arm tensed a bit, until he started to process what was said. He started to nod, giving into hopeful words. Tears were warm on his cheeks, now that he wasn&#39;t scared to close his eyes. 

&quot;I- I promise I&#39;m here to help you. I&#39;ll make this work. I&#39;ll figure things out.&quot; He rubbed his eyes and reached for his PET one more time. &quot;Blues&#39;ll help too... sorry Blues.&quot; he frowned and sniffled, and turned the sound back on. 

Blues didn&#39;t say anything yet. He watched Laika&#39;s hand placement, and bowed his head to Enzan.</span>

Sitting side by side, he wouldn&#39;t have to hurt himself. Enzan&#39;s cheeks were carefully dabbed, and Laika ensured that he&#39;d stay close. His erratic breathing was starting to even out. 

&quot;Thank you...&quot; He expressed his gratitude once more. Laika looked up at the clock displayed on one of the computers. &quot;The dimensional area will come back when the others get here. Until then, mm...&quot;

Laika bowed his head, and found a spot to rest it on Enzan&#39;s shoulder. He adjusted his scarf, to make sure it covered damaged skin around his neck. His sigh was shaky, and his body held light tremors as it tried to catch up with the excitement. 

&quot;I... I need medicine.&quot; He breathed. &quot;Did you tell them that...? I&#39;m starting to run out of what Regal left behind.&quot;</span>

&quot;Laika-sama.&quot; Blues finally spoke up. This was something to identify and hold onto. He <em>needed</em> to unravel the inconsistencies in what he had heard, before Enzan&#39;s safety could be garunteed. Regal&#39;s plot was thick, and Blues didn&#39;t doubt that Laika being left alive was a big part. &quot;I apologize, I know it is too soon. But I must know if you can identify any of the substances-- or, symptoms.&quot;

Enzan frowned. That seemed so beside the point. After all that fussing to communicate, Blues was interrogating about <em>health?</em></span>

But when Blues spoke, he hesitated. Laika sucked in a breath before his lips twisted. He didn&#39;t move from where he rested.

The computers clicked and whirred in normal operation. Nothing was amiss.

&quot;Symptoms.&quot; Laika gasped. &quot;What does it look like? Burns. These are just the small ones.&quot;

He clawed his hand up Enzan&#39;s vest, just enough to ensure Blues could see. 

&quot;Bigger. All over. And they <em>hurt</em>. Always hurting, but the medicine makes it hurt less. That&#39;s all.&quot;</span>

&quot;I am trying to understand.&quot; Blues defended, &quot;we still do not know what Regal intended by all of this. It&#39;s elaborate-- too elaborate to let our guards down. We have never known him to afford <em>anyone</em> any kindness. I am worried-- he is using you, Laika-sama.&quot; 

Enzan shuddered. <em>&quot;Blues.</em> Concentrate on figuring out what went wrong. We&#39;ll still need to fight. Later.&quot; His hand lightly brushed Laika&#39;s where he saw no scabbing. The patches were small.</span>

Laika dropped it, but kept himself attached to Enzan. He cherished the touch, leaning into it. There came a small sight as it ended, and his hands futhered their advancement. One came around Enzan&#39;s back, while the other stayed gripping his front.

It stayed quiet as Laika kept this hold. His shakes and gasps were gone now that he had the chance to be close. The only thing unsteady were deep breaths, as they hitched at the peak of intake. 

Around them computer static mixed with the sound of the sea. Churning processors and tide seemed to get lost in each other&#39;s existence. It seemed to meld perfectly with the background processes of finding safety.

&quot;Enzan...?&quot; Laika lifted his head, finally. His hands stayed in place. &quot;Did. You need anything? Food? Water?&quot;</span>

He continued to search for places to touch and avoid hurting Laika. A different kind of sorrow mixed inside him as their calm moment progressed. He felt subdued, small. What was taking Pen and Manabe so long? 

&quot;I... just want to be close. I m-missed you so much.&quot; Focusing on this moment and making it <em>real</em> in his head was a struggle. &quot;I&#39;m trying to... make sense of it all. But there really isn&#39;t any.&quot;</span>

He smiled slightly at the joke, but it quickly faded. His gaze studied the small leftovers of what had happened during Christmas time. Little bruises dotted Enzan&#39;s skin like a necklace, still healing after two months. Laika studied and studied as the noises rolled around them. 

The wind was starting to pick up outside. Clouds could be seen out the window with a bullet hole. They were still far off from the island. 

Laika breathed in, and pulled back the hand around Enzan&#39;s back for a moment. It curled into his coat, then stretched out. It was back within seconds. 

&quot;This is the calmest I&#39;ve felt in... I&#39;m not sure how long.&quot; Laika muttered. &quot;I&#39;m so relieved... now that there&#39;s someone I trust here. And I&#39;m happy. Happy you trust me too. Still.&quot;</span>

&quot;Enzan-sama.&quot; Blues&#39; voice came slowly from the PET. &quot;Perhaps you <em>should</em> get some water. We must be in top form.&quot; The navi was watching the both of them carefully. Still, something was out of place! Enzan made a small noise of acceptance, but didn&#39;t make any move to get up. 

&quot;Laika-sama. You were outside when we arrived. Why?&quot; Blues pivoted. Laika hadn&#39;t been hunting-- the gun was left on the wall. Laika hadn&#39;t even seemed in a hurry to return to the building, despite the dimensional area.

&quot;Is it a crime to try and explore a crash?&quot; Laika grumbled. &quot;Imagine for a moment, my joy to see an IPC helicopter approaching this place. Imagine that joy being wiped away the second the dimensional area sent you both into peril.&quot;

Enzan was gripped a little tighter, as much as the wounds would allow.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t stop myself from trying to reach you before that darkloid did. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry for not being safe.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">&quot;...I see. I apologize. I suppose I overestimated how injured you are.&quot; Blues&#39; voice took an edge, testing. Enzan&#39;s stomach churned again-- his navi was breaking the fragile calm, and setting his heart racing again. Why did they have to rely on him right now? 

&quot;Try to stay safe now...&quot; Enzan murmured, &quot;we&#39;ll be okay. Just a little longer.&quot; He was breathing shallowly, scared to jostle Laika. Ever so slowly, Enzan lifted his hand to search for a comforting gesture to offer back.

Ever so lightly, he brushed over the rain-slicker. His head raised. Instead of softness underneath, he felt the ridges of something firm. He pulled away quickly. 

&quot;Ah-?&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">A shaky sigh tied off the words exchanged. Laika ignored Blues, in favor of nuzzling his nose against Enzan&#39;s skin.

&quot;Yes... yes, I&#39;ll try.&quot; 

The gasps of Laika&#39;s words stopped short when Enzan touched. The stutter of breath brought a smile back, one far too soon to be tied to anything good. Laika slipped something out of his sleeve behind Enzan&#39;s back and got it ready in his hand.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He asked. Laika was suddenly hugging tighter than ever. Something thin and sharp threatened to pass through his lover&#39;s side. &quot;Enzan...?&quot;</span>

Of course, Enzan&#39;s mind supplied, this had to be another one of Regal&#39;s poisons. Enzan was still trapped in that cell, writhing on the floor. A hallucination. Of course. Enzan had no more soft moments of comfort. They were not allowable. 

&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Blues couldn&#39;t <em>see</em> the threat, but just Enzan&#39;s face was enough. That remained-- Blues could always read him. The PET fell into Enzan&#39;s lap. &quot;Enzan-sama!&quot;</span>

Their voice hardened as they lifted their head. &#39;Laika&#39; sat up, breathing in as their hand slid across Enzan&#39;s back. The syringe that was in it was brought up for display, to rest with the hand on Enzan&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Though, the way you say his name is so sweet... I could get use to it. But he is not me.&quot;

Their other hand pulled away to undo the bulky scarf wrapped around the neck. It revealed more of the burns that travelled up their neck. The freedom seemed something to celebrate based off their expression. It was euphoric. 

&quot;Enzan...&quot; Blues was throughly ignored. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to work with you. You will be all mine. Very, very soon.&quot;</span>

His hand flew up, gripping Laika&#39;s wrist. He pulled it away, fingers and nails pressing down into his lover&#39;s skin. 

His other hand clutched his PET back up. 

&quot;No. No. No.&quot; The chant started, and it wouldn&#39;t stop. Enzan clutched as hard as he could, while pushing away with the rest of his body. He scrambled away on the ground, and let go only once he had gained distance.</span>

&quot;He has a good amount of useful qualities, this thing!&quot; They exclaimed. &quot;Sadly, strength and infulence aren&#39;t among those. Not since I arrived.&quot;

They reached up to remove their coat. It was tossed aside to reveal the long sleeved shirt that hugged tightly underneath. More freedom, enough to sigh and look comfortable in light of Enzan&#39;s fear. A glance was thrown to the wrist that was grabbed. There was redness there.

&quot;So, that&#39;s where you come in.&quot; They hummed. &quot;We&#39;ll work together, like always. Don&#39;t you want that?&quot;

With the room secured, &#39;Laika&#39; waltzed over to the computers that lined the walls. They tacked away at a keyboard, humming a simple Sharonian lullaby. On their back was a contraption that rose under the shirt. What peaked out was steel and blinking lights, it&#39;s tip embedded into the base of their neck.</span>

His bloodied hand reached into his pocket while &#39;Laika&#39;s attention was elsewhere. He focused in on the metal device. That had to be what was doing this-- there was nothing else he could identify. 

&quot;...&quot; Enzan&#39;s voice was gone-- his mind nearly was too. Pure animal instinct withdrew his pocket knife and brought him closer to the creature that had taken residence here. Disgust wasn&#39;t enough to keep him from action. 

He stared at the syringe they wielded. Enzan brought the knife to their back. &quot;Drop! it!&quot;</span>

Their pinky made a final keystroke before looking up. Hard drives clicked and whirred within their normal states. They didn&#39;t comply. The syringe was played with in their hand, the cap still over the neddle point.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t.&quot; They sighed. &quot;It will get rid of me, sure, but do you really want the death of him on your hands too?&quot;

They tested Enzan&#39;s determination, by testing to see just how close the know really was. Their back swayed close, then a little farther again. 

&quot;If it&#39;s bothered, it&#39;s rigged to shoot all the medicine in at once. And it just so happens to be pretty potent. I can&#39;t imagine this frail thing handling more than the prescribed dosage~&quot;</span>

Blood soaked through the shirt, without even cutting through. Enzan&#39;s breath stopped. Laika&#39;s hair. Laika&#39;s blood. 

Enzan&#39;s hands shook until the knife dropped. 

&quot;No. Needles. N-o-hh-&quot; It was a countdown of milliseconds before tears would blind him. He lunged for the syringe arm and squeezed again. More blood. He gasped, and couldn&#39;t see. The needle was there though, and he was ready to wrestle it out of Their hand.</span>

Anger flashed across their features, but they wouldn&#39;t let go of the precious commodity. The dark fluid inside it jostled as they struggled.

&quot;Gggh!&quot; &#39;Laika&#39; grunted, and forced their elbow into Enzan&#39;s chest. The speed helped severity, and they spun around to face the room proper. &quot;You&#39;re making this harder than- ngh! Than it has to be!&quot;

Their other hand became involved, and with it &#39;Laika&#39; gripped Enzan&#39;s hair. They yanked back, to tear him off and throw him towards the cot nearby. Unreasonable strength was summoned for the task, strength a ailing body should never have.

&quot;If you want to make this a <em>game</em> then fine! But you&#39;ll play by my rules!&quot; They spat.

The computers started to make more noise, and with them came a brilliant light from outside the building. A dome again, bringing saturated colors and electricity to the air. The sound of something forming right outside made &#39;Laika&#39; sneer.</span>

His head jerked back, and still he held. Three. He couldn&#39;t remember the steps between, and he was laying on the cot. He gasped in a breath, and groped around for his knife, or his PET. The colors of the dimensional area were dizzying. 

&quot;Enzan-sama!&quot; Blues&#39; voice was registered as a true <em>voice</em>, now that Enzan needed him. Enzan lunged for where it had fallen, gathering it into his hands. Knife, the knife! It too was on the floor, but by <em>their</em> feet. 

Impulsively, Enzan kept moving. He grabbed for the small hilt. &quot;Stay-- away from. Me!&quot;</span>

When Enzan bolted forward again, they forced him down to the ground, just short of where the knife laid. They put a leg over one arm while they fought to keep the other at bay. 

&quot;No.&quot; They growled. &quot;Absolutely no-t.&quot;

The hum of the internet thrummed through the scene as &#39;Laika&#39; found their opening. It was going to happen, right now. The first dose. They hastily shoved the needle downward towards Enzan&#39;s bicep.

But deep and unsettling coughs took over their movements, without warning. &#39;Laika&#39; was forced off of Enzan&#39;s back, to the floor nearby as blood started to speckle out. The syringe was left lying where it missed, it&#39;s needle crushed by the concrete floor.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan <em>screamed</em>. His shoulder hit the ground and he pushed with his whole body to be anywhere but there. Enzan grabbed the knife and moved away until his back hit a computer leg. He saw the broken syringe, and got unsteadily to his feet. There was a magnifying pull, making him want to grab and <em>hold</em> it. But, he used that energy like a slingshot, and stomped on it as hard as he could. The flask cracked. He stomped one more time, and the black liquid spilled out onto the floor. 

&quot;H--haa--&quot; Enzan pointed his knife at &#39;Laika&#39;, and tapped his PET. &quot;Blues u-unlock the-- fuck.&quot; His free hand reached for his synchro chip. He flicked it out of its pouch, and held it ready. 

&quot;The net police-- they&#39;ll be here. They&#39;ll. Help. Fix.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The coughs caused them to writhe in pain on the floor. Sounds of stomping forced them to look around, to see the dose leak onto the concrete floor. They looked around fury as dark eyes found Enzan. Fingers clawed at the floor, to get up as the coughing for ended.

&quot;D-damn- YOU!!!&quot; Their words didn&#39;t face Enzan directly, but their rage hit all the same. &#39;Laika&#39; stood up, holding their chest as small blossoms of red bled through his shirt. The coughs and excitement had caused wounds to open.

After a few breaths, their grin reappeared. Like they had never lost their composure.

&quot;The NetPolice. It&#39;ll be to- late when they arrive. The game will have already begun.&quot; They hissed. &quot;Since you won&#39;t o-obey. My darkloid friend can have some fun!&quot;

From outside, metallic footsteps could be heard again. They came up to the window, the, then around the side, stopping just short of the front of the building. &#39;Laika&#39; walked back to the computers and stared at Enzan while they dug up an old PET from the papers. It wasn&#39;t green, it wasn&#39;t Searchman&#39;s. 

&quot;He hasn&#39;t had a hunt inside the dimensional area yet. He might throughly enjoy it. Then, when you lose, you&#39;ll have no choice. You&#39;ll be <em>mine.</em>&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan stepped back from them, eyes wide. There was so much blood. The yelling was so difficult not to crumble under. Blues was yelling too! It was too much! Quiet, <em>quiet!</em> Did he wail for worry of Laika&#39;s body? Or fear for his own life? One moment he thought he might be able to overpower them, the next, they showed strength as great as a copyroid navi. 

Enzan moved for the door, grabbing the handle and jostling without looking. 

&quot;We&#39;ll. win.&quot; As firm as Enzan&#39;s voice was, his body shuddered. They hadn&#39;t lost to a darkloid since Shademan. But, could they even crossfuse? His chest still hurt from the failed cross, and his limbs were like rubber.  

Enzan looked to the window, then back at &#39;Laika&#39;. Enzan managed to unlock the first latch. He yanked, and it still didn&#39;t open. He turned the smaller latch. Yank, still didn&#39;t open. His breathing hitched and panic sped up his movements. The door inched open-- he didn&#39;t remember it being this <em>heavy</em>. One more pull, and there was just enough space to slip through.</span>

They kept up their chuckles whenever they could, between gasps and hissings against the pain. The door finally creaked open, and with it they took a step forward. Enzan was out of view, but that was fine. They were letting him get away. 

Downstairs, there were slight changes, ones brought forth by the nature of the island around them. The wind had picked up, and was cooling the concrete to temperatures like ice. It shuffled peelings of paint around the ground, and pushed open a door close to the stairs. In the dark, small lights could be seen, signals of electricity, computation, possible artificial life. 

&quot;Enzan!&quot; The imposter called from the top of the stairs. &quot;I haven&#39;t explained the rules! Where oh where did you go~?&quot;</span>

He wasn&#39;t ready to attempt another fusion. His health sensor was showing rates nearly off the scale. It was impressive he hadn&#39;t passed out yet.

Enzan slid into the open room, sliding into the dark as quickly as he could. He stumbled over dozens and dozens of wires and cords. His hand slammed down on a table to stay steady, and it lead his gaze up to the displays. 

Navis. Or what was left of them. It was a graveyard of nearly-deleted frames. His lips parted in aw of the destruction. 

And right in the center, Searchman. He was displayed largest of all, broken nearly to the point of unrecognition. Enzan swallowed down a shout to him. Stasis bars surrounded him, and a small screen below showed some of his coding.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Boots scruffed down the stairs, and the sound of Laika&#39;s body breathing heavily drew closer. A zipper ran up it&#39;s course when they hit the first floor. They shuffled past at first, looking down the other corridors before rounding back. Something was picked up, and it made a silence shattering <em>kl-clack</em> when it was in their arms.

&quot;Ah...&quot; A gasp, and they closed in. The door was pushed open, and their hand probed the wall.

Sudden, blinding light.

&quot;There you are.&quot;

&#39;Laika&#39; stood in the doorway, with their coat on and rifle slung over one shoulder. Their eyes didn&#39;t adjust to the change of brightness, pupils stayed pinpricks no matter what. A smile was plastered on their lips as they looked down at Enzan.

&quot;They&#39;re my trophies, from other games.&quot; They hummed. &quot;Eventually they&#39;ll be repurposed, to aid in my spread.&quot;

&quot;But you...&quot; They continued, stepping closer. &quot;You&#39;re a different case. You&#39;re game is different. In few moments it&#39;ll begin. You&#39;ll have 5 minutes before he starts to hunt you down. Will you use cross fusion? Will you try to out run him until the NetPolice arrive?&quot;

They unshouldered their rifle, and held it up to aim. To point at Enzan. Their smile dropped. 

&quot;Either way... You&#39;ll be part of my spread when the hour is up. Now get up.&quot;</span>

He&#39;d recognized the sound from before, but somehow hoped it wasn&#39;t real. This sort of weapon should only exist in backcountry and ancient movies. 

He raised his hands in a show of how defenseless he was. Enzan stepped out of the wires and closer to the weapon. &quot;Once they get here, it&#39;s over. Whether I lose or not, it&#39;s over. There&#39;s too much evidence to trick them.&quot; He let the gun dangerously close to himself. His voice trembled and broke. &quot;Laika. You will make it out of here.&quot; 

Enzan flicked out his synchro chip. Blues had been silent. He plunged the chip in. Blue light surrounded him in a perfect sphere, pushing &#39;Laika&#39; back.</span>

Mighty light shoved them back to the wall. The shelf nearby teetered from the tremors, threatening to topple all the tech that lied upon them. Their rifle fell to the floor, unable to hurt anything now that it was out of it&#39;s master&#39;s hands. 

Blinded, they laughed. The laughed loudly, enough to earn a pity cough or two once they settled. 

When they could see again, Enzan was gone.

They raced through the mucky hills, and skidded down the tallest one to reach the other side of the island. Their feet stopped in front of a fallen tree, where they leaned over and wretched. For Enzan&#39;s sake, the last of his upset was released. They needed both their heads in the game. 

The sooner they had a good lay of the land, the sooner they could find placed of cover or advantage. They pieced together what they knew about this navi. 

Probably faster than Searchman, since he&#39;d been beaten. He couldn&#39;t count on that advantage saving him. The bullet they had seen came in at an angle they couldn&#39;t have shot from the ground, so all angles had to be considered. They kept an eye on the sky. They ran everywhere, and a few seconds passed into the fifth minute. 

Best places on the island for cover. High, hidden cavern-like areas, not ideal but they do supply the high ground. The cliffs on every side of the island, dangerous for R Blues but hopefully more-so for an enemy.</span>

&quot;<em>&#39;ts been five minutes.</em>&quot; He grumbled.

The imposter sneered. &quot;Then go. But you&#39;ll take me with you. I want to see everything.&quot;

Countershade only grunted in response, and reached out to grab them.

---

The island was limited in space, giving the players only a few kilometers of useful terrain. The mountain just off center was nothing but pines and snowfall. It&#39;s caves were shallow, barely suitable for anything other than shelter from the approaching storms. 

R Blues was traced to these wanderings, and Countershade approached with the imposter in tow. They were dropped off half a click away, to hide low and watch the scenes of battle unfold. 

Their carriage was nowhere to be seen, but his footsteps we&#39;re heavy. They crushed the sticks and snow of wherever was travelled, following behind the half marks of R Blues&#39; rapid pacing. Countershade halted, invisible, and scanned the area. His target was right beside him.</span>

R Blues&#39; mind&#39;s raced faster than any human or normal navi could. He predicted the possible moves Countershade could make and kept his sword raised. Every step kept him moving; his own form of stealth. 

Shield was kept ready, and their sword was out. They shot a wide spread sonic boom over the footprints, calculating the Darkloid&#39;s speed. How many dark chips did it have in its system?</span>

The crack of a shot shattered the silence. It whized passed R Blues, leaving a trail of red light behind it. A warning shot, because Countershade was underestimated. He quickly lept out of the way of any repurcussions.

The bullet struck a nearby tree, altering it&#39;s course near the speed of sound. The red was the only way to track it, and even by that it was too late. It had hit another tree, and was whizzing towards it&#39;s target again. 

Ricochet was the name of this game.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The first ricochet brought R Blues to attention, watching and calculating the width of where the bullet was heading next. They jumped back out of the possible angles just in time and shot a sonic boom into its path. 

They had no idea where their enemy was. R Blues showed the possibility Countershade had jumped away from their footprints in their visor. They needed thicker cover, but that meant more opportunity for ricochet. 

They decided to forego tracing bullets, and activated their boosters. They burst through the tree cover and hovered above with sword ready. 

A bit of smoke might help identify the problem. R Blues called out a firesword, and grazed the tops of trees with its attack.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The thrust kicked up rock and dirt to cover Countershade&#39;s feet for a brief moment. He quickly backed away from take off, and walked to where the trees were thin. In that time, the woods began to light up with embers. Whisps of smoke rose from the canopy.

&quot;<em>Y&#39; didn&#39;t say he was capable of sustained flight.</em>&quot; Countershade grumbled under his breath. A breathy laugh came over the communication channel in his receptors.

&quot;Are you complaining? Do you need a boost?&quot;

Countershade whipped his rifle skyward in silence, and aimed for the trees. Several shots were let loose, bouncing off the bark to the sky. Streams of red hurdled towards R Blues. The darkloid dashed through the smoke, his invisible frame just barely outlined by it. 

He fired again, but this time the shots were a brilliant blue. They knocked around the trees, faster and faster, gaining energy exponentially, but never rising up.</span>

<em>It will adapt. We must go now,</em> Blues offered, <em>AreaSteal</em>. 

R Blues vanished from their station in the sky, and reappeared in Countershade&#39;s path of movement. They slashed up with their Firesword just before their basic sword returned. <em>Angles. Work the angles.</em> Enzan instructed Blues&#39; processing power to follow the blue bullet, now that they were in range again. 

<em>Energy increasing. It needs to be disrupted. The longer it goes, the stronger.</em> 

Fire was spreading down the hill, surrounding them and increasing the treachery of the fight. Countershade&#39;s blue bullet made trees it hit start to quake and threaten to topple over.</span>

Countershade stifled a grunt as the fire flew close, and sliced the edge of his poncho. His invisiblty failed for a moment, revealing himself fully to his prey. Anger flashed down as red shone from under the large disc. Then the towering figure was gone, invisible. 

Hi rifle opened fire, spewing red trails to bounce off the surrounding trees. Some came from above, some came from below, from the side and the other side. 

It was too late to stop the blue ones. They finally formed a crooked halo up above in the fire. Their heat joined in with the flames, releasing a catastrophic explosion. Countershade was long gone from the scene, lurching in silence, watching his prey to snatch before death.</span>

R Blues&#39; visor closed, and his shield came up to defend from the brunt of the explosion. A handful of red bullets met its front as well. R Blues hunched down to avoid. A bullet struck them in the back of the knee. They fell to it, but their sword remained overhead, protecting from the worst of it. Another struck his shoulder then, coming down from above. 

<em>Boosters! No, it&#39;s too late!</em> Their thoughts melded together, as one more bullet managed to crack through their defenses. Their helmet was cracked, effecting hearing receptors on the right side. 

<em>We <strong>had</strong> him!</em> R Blues descended all the way to the ground with shield overhead until the chaos quieted a bit. Then in a sudden rush, they blasted back up above the flaming trees.</span>

The fire took quickly to the timbers, and continue to spread outward. Their side of the mountain began to feel like a long dormant volcano had awakened. The smoke billowed upwards, only to get trapped by the artificial ceiling. Beyond the dimensional area, rain started to fall.

Countershade waited until his branch succumbed to the flames. As he fell, shots rang out. Their red tails whizzed past R Blues, missing, disappearing into the smoke. More came after he rolled out and dashed towards the rock face. They were blue, and bounced off the smouldering trees just feet above the ground. They were hidden by the sulfur and ash.

When he came to a stop, he decloaked himself. Free for Blues to see.</span>

<em>The rain. Pen. NetPolice.</em> 

Enzan&#39;s thoughts started to pull away from the fight. Pixels threatened to pull them away from each other, as Enzan&#39;s heart raced. <em>We will sustain.</em> Blues tried to calm him. 

At least they were together on their next move. They shot sonic booms in another wide spray, before switching out for a HeroSword. Their range for attack increased, but they still needed to get closer to do any damage. They clearly couldn&#39;t dodge forever. Their visor picked up on the increasing energy trails down below, but couldn&#39;t process fast enough to tell where it would end up. They spotted Countershade, and swooped down from above to slash the longer sword into his saucer. Just before they reached him, they activated another chip. 

&quot;Rock cube!&quot; The grey blocks slammed down into the path of the bullets, crushing trees and stamping out some of the fire.</span>

<em>Ka-BOOM!!!</em>

The rock cubes quickly became projectles in the blast. A shock wave caught Countershade, carrying him a safe distance away to hide and plot. He vanished into the untouched woods, disc sparking.

Meanwhile, the imposter sneered. Their hand dropped the binoculars to thump against their chest. A steady grip held thier rifle. All this time they were inching closer and closer to the battle, but keeping a respectful distance away from wildfire.

&quot;Come on, come on...&quot; The hissed. &quot;You&#39;re barely showing your best.&quot;</span>

They groaned when their injured leg hit the ground, but had to power through it. Bursts of speed still seemed to be their one advantage. The sparks of Countershade&#39;s visor melded with the fires around R Blues, so they raced for cleaner space. 

Instead of pursuing Countershade however, they followed the ping on their visor. Laika. They gritted their teeth. The crossfusion faltered. <em>Enzan-sama, we&#39;re going to get shot in the back for this if he manages to hide the spark.</em>

Enzan ignored the warning, and they approached &quot;Laika.&quot; They were dangerously close to where the explosion&#39;s shrapnel had landed. This increased their protective needs. R Blues disabled their sword, and scooped &quot;Laika&quot; up. they tried not to look at their captive, but instead started a beeline for the building they had started in.</span>

Their protests we&#39;re hushed by the rush of running. If still, the yells would surely be petrifying.

Countershade clicked his tongue, and followed after in silence. He stifled grunts that stemmed from the damage to his hat. Precious systems of radar and calculation we&#39;re becoming unstable. 

Still, he rose his rifle to fire. Red marked bullets bounced off the trees to bite at R Blues&#39; heels. They came in waves over and over, to chase and antagonize. It didn&#39;t matter what he was holding.</span>

R Blues&#39; hair fell freely over his shoulders and flung back from the wind. The difference in balance made the way he made his turns just ever so slightly different. And that was enough. 

They dodged a few bullets, but were grazed on the right side as they approached the building. Just as they entered the doorway, another red bullet struck their upper thigh on the left side. Both their legs were damaged now, badly. They slammed the door shut behind them. 

R Blues wheezed and set the imposter down, repulsed by their proximity. Pixels danced down from all their various wounds, lit up in the darkened space. Masking blood. 

Their form flickered, once. 

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t swing around such dangerous toys.&quot; They nodded to the gun they were so intent on carrying around. R Blues hadn&#39;t taken it from them. It was the only one working under a human&#39;s power now.</span>

Rage forced &#39;Laika&#39; up from the ground, snatching rifle and bringing it up to fire. They backed up to stay out of range. Out of the barren lobby, just barely into a corroded corridor. 

&quot;You&#39;re still going to be <em>mine.</em>&quot; They spat. &quot;Do you really think this place will help you?! I don&#39;t care about loosing what&#39;s in here, so long as I get <em>you.</em>&quot;

Outside, several calculations were taking place. Countershade&#39;s head let off a spark as he finalized a trajectory. His rifle rose up, and aimed careful at a tree nearby. A few more moments to double check. This shot required time.</span>

They walked forward. 

&quot;We are already Laika&#39;s.&quot; They smiled, softly, before their visor closed. Their form flickered once more. 

A clatter came from the other end of the building, and the R Blues in front of &quot;Laika&quot; collapsed into a substitute dummy.</span>

Red lit up the window, bounced off the walls, and passed through R Blues&#39; visage. The other bullet had already triggered the doll, leaving Countershade&#39;s to buzz past &#39;Laika&#39;s&#39; head. The imposter&#39;s eyes went wide as strands of their hair fell to the floor.

&quot;Ggrrh- Damn!&quot; They growled at the noise behind them. &quot;Go around back! Now!&quot;

The order came with silence as a response. Countershade was already gone. The second his faulty radar picked up a third target, he left his keeper behind. He kept their rifle up and ready to fire as he approached the new target.</span>

Enzan was struggling to stay in the moment and keep pushing forward. Laika was back there. Laika wanted to hurt him. They couldn&#39;t even save Searchman. They couldn&#39;t even take down this <em>one</em> darkloid. Enzan didn&#39;t want a tactical retreat. He wanted to fight until he died trying to save him--

<em>Just a bit longer Enzan. Mura masa is still available should this fail. We will protect.</em> 

They glanced back to where their enemies would surely come from. The door, or around the side. Their feet edged to the rim of the building. Just a bit closer... one more shot, and they may be able to pull off enough deception to hide until the net police arrived. 

R Blues breathed deeply. Their boosters activated, and they shot out over the cliff to hover high above the crashing waves. They scanned for that tiny spark, a target to aim at.</span>

With them flying around, Countershade moved. He ignored the sounds of his footsteps made, they were covered by explosion and the imposter&#39;s movements. The spark arched as he rounded the building&#39;s corner. He aimed at the floating target, directly.

But the crack of another rifle disrupted the air. On the roof was the imposter, pulling back the bolt of their rifle. 

&quot;Almost got you...&quot; They sneered.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">R Blues sent flicks of endless sonic booms at whatever they could sense of Countershade. It was a wide spread. They relied on their speed, but the force of the explosions rocked them in the air. 

<em>Laika is in danger!</em> They caught sight of the imposter on their sensors. The single bullet had nearly gone unnoticed. 

An explosion clipped R Blues right side just as they came in a small bit closer to the cliff face. They teetered in the air, a perfect target for just a second. 

Bam BAM

<em>Enzan!</em> 

Two shots struck R Blues&#39; chest, just below the navi symbol.

&quot;Lai-ka!&quot; They were suddenly falling, falling. They tumbled through the sky, descended below the cliff, and plunged into the water.


It was calm in the water. As much as the waves were visible from above, the dimensional area protected from the raging storm outside. Freezing water assaulted their bare head. This time consciousness barely kept the cross together. <em>Survive</em>, they said. But darkness was so seductive down here. Calm. Their wounds did not hurt beyond the feeling of ice.</span>

Ka-BOOM!

One of the bullets exploded, and it&#39;s shocks forced &#39;Laika&#39; to fall. They gasped as only half of their body hit the concrete of the roof. The rest hung off the crumbling side, close to falling with R Blues into the sea.

&quot;Shit!&quot; They exclaimed, loud enough for Countershade to hear. 

He grinned. &quot;<em>Stop interferin&#39; and ya won&#39;t get banged up.</em>&quot;

A growl came in response as the imposter fixed themselves. Instead of picking up their rifle, a PET was scrounged up. With it, a murky looking chip.

&quot;You&#39;re going to retrieve him. Now.&quot; They hissed. &quot;Don&#39;t forget our arrangement.&quot;

Countershade couldn&#39;t get a word in, for the next second a wave of power surged through him. He let out a horrible yell as the sparking of his disc disappeared. A dark cloud seemed to overtake him. Then it was gone, leaving Countershade looking down at the ocean ravenously. He lept in to retrieve the prize the imposter saught.</span>

Water droplets. Countershade will be fully visible. Closer. A sword-- could they summon a sword? Everything was spinning. Was Laika alright? There were so many sounds, it was too hard to tell over the buzzing of his damaged senses. 

R Blues managed to climb up a few feet out of the water. They activated their basic sword, and shoved it in as an anchor. As quickly as they could, they activated, deactivated, and reactivated to climb up what would otherswise have been immpassible.

Halfway up, and the rocks gave way. They fell back another quarter of the way before their boosters reactivated.</span>

&quot;<em>Yer dead.</em>&quot; he growled once he was in earshot of R Blues. From under his poncho shot out a hand, to grip as he fired another volley to propell them both up the cliffs. 

From far above, &#39;Laika&#39; breemed worth excitement. Their grin couldn&#39;t be erased. Their knuckles were white from gripping the PET so hard.</span>

Their sword pulled out of the cliff-face, and his petite frame dangled helplessly over the now deadly water. They reached up to grasp at Countershade&#39;s arm-- the cross was fragile enough that their neck couldn&#39;t take the pressure. 

<em>Sword. Sword!</em> 

Their arm transformed. A paladin sword lit up their arm, but was fracturing from the elbow down. Both of them were operating on bare instincts. 

They swung the sword out and up, hoping for contact with the arm they couldn&#39;t see. It grazed Countershade&#39;s bicep, and slashed through his abdomen. 

Then the sword shattered.</span>

There was no signs of an attempt to get out. 

The imposter&#39;s grin quickly turned around. They scowled and turned away, snatching up their gun as they went back into the building. It was to ground level, with haste. They needed to meet their prey at the top of the cliffs.</span>

They activated a healing chip in the brief moments they had, collapsed on the edge of the island. Energy swirled around only their arm: a poor patch job. 

They crawled and stumbled towards the building. Finding Laika, before Counershade managed to show himself again, was their top priority. 

All the booster use had aggravated bullet wounds, so their legs were slowly becoming useless. A couple more pushes, and they might not get back up again. They didn&#39;t know where to go after this. Back into the trees? There was no more fighting after this. The crossfusion flickered once more.

&quot;Laika-- I&#39;m not. Giving up.&quot; They tried to smile. It didn&#39;t reach their eyes. Blues was begging Enzan to run. Enzan wanted to stay, to <em>do</em> something but it was so illogical and Blues couldn&#39;t understand--

They rolled their shoulders, and didn&#39;t skip a beat once R Blues was standing. Walking backwards, they nodded back. 

&quot;Follow. Inside. I&#39;ll figure out how to get you defused when you&#39;re-&quot;

The Other was cut off by a large shadow flying up from the cliffs. It eclipsed them and R Blues as it soared overhead and landed behind them.

Countershade. He was snarling, crazed. From under the disc eyes glowed red, glaring down at his target. 

&quot;<em>Yyyoooiuuu...</em>&quot; he growled.</span>

Mura masa burned with their blood. It transformed out of Blues&#39; navi symbol and rested, nearly weightless in their hand. All their pain and suffering were sucked into the demon sword. Their finisher. A desperation hung from the hand that grasped the sword.

Now the matter was moving their feet to meet their enemy.</span>

&quot;I assumed you let yourself die.&quot; They hummed. &quot;Whatever, you can still help. Initiate the freeze progr-&quot;

&quot;<em>Yerr... takin&#39; m&#39; killlll....</em>&quot; Countershade hissed. His shoulders heaved with a dark clout. It was teeming inside of him, forcing him to be savage. &quot;<em>You&#39;re takin&#39; M&#39; KIIILL!</em>&quot;

The roar came with swift action. Countershade whipped his rifle out, hooking The Other by the throat, and slamming them into the side of the building. The fragile human squeaked like a kicked dog. 

Their limbs started to shake in panic as air was impossible to obtain. They had barely any grip on the rifle at their neck. The force had broken something. A dark murky liquid too, similar to blood, began to drip off their feet.

&quot;<em>I&#39;M DONE WITH YOU!</em>&quot; Countershade barked at them, completely ignoring the danger behind the shield. He watched as &#39;Laika&#39; flailed helplessly in the air. The craning of their mouth seemed like such a pleasure to behold.</span>

Pain disappeared into rage. Their vision flashed red. All the weakness that had kept them stumbling seemed like a lifetime ago. 

First, the half removed arm was sliced clean off. Then, through the waist. Legs. Slash, slash, cut, cut, slash slashslashslash-- 

Until they met no more resistance. 

The dark auras dissipated, and so did the crossfusion. Enzan fell down into the grey slush, supported by one arm. He ignored the fallen PET and crawled to The Other&#39;s... Laika&#39;s? Side. 

&quot;No, no-- <em>jesus</em>, no!&quot; Enzan&#39;s good hand clawed through the slush. He coughed up something, but he didn&#39;t care. He didn&#39;t stop pushing his body until Laika&#39;s head was in his hand. He searched for the source of the bleeding, <em>anything</em> to help. &quot;Laika!&quot;</span>

Countershade was swiftly annihilated, the power of Muramasa being far more than what he could handle. He disintergated into deletion right there, leaving his victim to fall limp on the ground. 

&#39;Laika&#39;s&#39; body didn&#39;t move until Enzan came up to it. Blood crept out of the side of it&#39;s mouth, and a dark liquid peeked out from the back of it&#39;s neck. The damage done by Countershade was mostly unseen, but severe nonetheless.

There were no signs of life, save for a flutter of a pulse and a wisp of breath. It remained still to Enzan&#39;s call, fitting of the ashen form it already held.</span>

Sobs rattled him, as blood and dark ooze covered his hands. Tears spattered down on Laika&#39;s chest. Cold... everything was so cold. The grey slush and mud were seeping into their clothes. 

Enzan coughed and sniffled-- and started to slowly drag the two of them into the door of the building. He was as gentle as he could be, but blood trailed behind them both.</span>

The dimensional area around them destabilized, forcing the island to face the sleet and wind. It came down hard at first, the built-up puddles falling to the Earth, but evened out once the colors returned to grey. Without the hum of electricity, everything felt so still. That was, until a rumble came from the distance.

A helicopter fought against the storm, braving the wind and surf to make it to the island. Manabe gripped the handle to stand and look out the front windows, grimacing. She rolled her shoulders, adjusting the tactical gear the situation obviously called for. 

&quot;That was a dimensional area just now.&quot; The pilot spoke over radio. &quot;It&#39;s not going to come back up, is it?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m unsure...&quot; Manabe answered, then turned to her compatriots in the back. &quot;Pen-kun, please see if you can contact Enzan. We need an update.&quot;</span>

Injury to throat and infected burns. Enzan is badly hurt. There was a darkloid, but they deleted it. He does not know the Dimensional area controls. He was seperated from Enzan.&quot; 

She paused to take a breath and closed her eyes. &quot;There is one more thing. Laika was under the influence of something similar to dark aura.&quot; 

She looked up from her PET, &quot;That&#39;s all he can report so far. We need to get down there. Even if the area reappears, we have the fire power. There&#39;s no time.&quot; 

She shouldered on her parachute. &quot;I am ready for whatever needs to be done.&quot;</span>

&quot;You&#39;ll go in ahead of landing, should the dimensional area reactivate.&quot; She ordered, staring through Pen&#39;s shoulder. &quot;After landing, EMTs will converge on your location and extract Enzan and... Laika.&quot;

The name was suddenly hard to say, but Manabe shook it off. They were getting close. 

It was too cold for thunder, yet the skies over the island rang with tenor peals. The helicopter was nothing more than a large dot in the sky, well out of range of the dimensional area observed. 

Manabe gripped tight and ordered her men to do the same. She looked to Pen and put a hand on the door&#39;s lever. 

&quot;Go!&quot; She barked, before rushing wind and stinging rain rushed them through the opening door.</span>

The young woman leaped from the helicopter door and entered freefall. She held her arms out in ready position to activate the parachute, or plunge in her synchro chip. 

A little late, she opened the shute, because the roaring winds threatened to push her away from land if she did it any sooner. She touched down among some trees, and reported back once her feet were on solid ground. 

&quot;All clear. I don&#39;t see any evidence of dimensional area. Beginning search. Blues reported they were in the building on the side closer to the water.&quot; Penelope unlatched her parachute, dumping it off where it landed. She approached the teetering building with her bo staff in one hand.

&quot;No evidence of people, commander. Approaching the structure. Send your people down.&quot;</span>

The helicopter flew in closer, lowering itself into a place to land. Before that, the medics jumped out, carrying large packs. With them, they guided a large basket, the kind normally seen during search and rescue missions.

Once the helicopter landed, Manabe hopped out. As she hussled towards the others, spoke into her radio. &quot;Be ready to take off the <em>second</em> we get everyone onboard.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;

Inside the building, computers idled, occasionally clicking and whirring for no apparent reason. It was still, eeriely so. The life of the place had before was almost gone.</span>

She scooped up the flash of red in the muck, and pocketed Blues. 

&quot;Enzan?&quot; Pen was caught between wanting to yell so he heard, and being wary of attack from any source. She shouldered the door open and immediately heard the sobbing. &quot;Oh, god--&quot; 

Enzan&#39;s eyes widened when the door opened. His body recoiled from the sound like a skittish cat. &quot;St-stay awa-y-&quot; 

Pen pocketed her bo staff. &quot;Hey-- hey.&quot; She held out her hands, &quot;we&#39;re here to help, Enzan. It&#39;s me. It&#39;s Pen. I&#39;m here with Manabe. We&#39;re going to get you home.&quot;

                    <span class="markdown">Manabe entered the building to see a sight only her nightmares could relate to. Medics we&#39;re swarming like bees, black and buzzing as they horded around the body on the floor. A chill shot down her spine as she spot Enzan on the corner. Interjections were swallowed, but prayers were risen up, silently. 

&quot;Enzan-kun.&quot; Manabe addressed as she walked past the group working on the ground. She couldn&#39;t look at it. All her focus was set on kneeling in front of Enzan, putting on a kind face. &quot;Everything&#39;s going to be alright.&quot;

Her eyes gazed to Pen, and then down to Enzan&#39;s legs. Eyes flashed open for a moment but quickly calmed. 

&quot;I need one of you over here, please.&quot; Manabe raised her voice over her shoulder. &quot;Quickly!&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t spare it!&quot; The lead medic replied back. His voice died down to match the low rumble of the rest. Their grouped tension filled the room. 

Manabe stared long and hard at the ground, then looked up. &quot;Pen, go get one of the first aid kits.&quot;</span>

&quot;Don&#39;t-- I&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t touch me.&quot; He scooted back, a little slower now. Enzan pushed into a sitting position and pain ricocheted like one of Countershade&#39;s bullets was inside of him. 

&quot;I have to get-- ggh--&quot; He placed his good hand to the wall, and started to push himself up onto bleeding legs. &quot;Blues. And-- hh... Searchman.&quot;

He edged away from Manabe and closer to the room with computers. The devices hummed and clicked behind a swinging door. 

Pen jogged back with the kit, and handed it to Manabe. &quot;Enzan-- I have Blues. It&#39;s okay. No more hurting.&quot;</span>

She glanced to where Enzan was heading, barely hearing the sound above the dreadful murmurs behind her. &quot;Enzan-kun please. You dont- You don&#39;t have to fight anymore. Listen, trust us.&quot;

She grabbed the kit from Pen&#39;s hand, and opened it. Antiseptic wash, padding, and gauze we&#39;re handed off. Manabe grabbed her own set. 

&quot;Get his arm, then help me with the legs.&quot; She ordered. Caring was put back in her words as she turned to Enzan before working. &quot;Blues is here. We&#39;ll get Searchman in just a moment. You are safe, Enzan-kun. Now... just hang on.&quot;

She purposed her knees to gently hold Enzan&#39;s legs between them as she popped the bottle&#39;s top off. Cleaning the wounds was always the worst part.</span>

Pen gently took Enzan&#39;s hand. She gave him a reassuring squeeze, before opening her own disinfectant bottle. Despite sitting, Enzan was restless. 

&quot;We need to leave-- we have to take Searchman and go.&quot; Enzan wrapped his hand around Penelope&#39;s wrist. The disinfectant made his voice pitch up, and break. However, it was nothing to his emotional strife. &quot;I can s-urvive this!&quot; 

Pen gritted her teeth until her jaw ached. &quot;Be still--&quot; her work was unsteady, but making progress. She wrapped his arm, and felt for fracture-- something was definitely displaced. &quot;Manabe, bleeding in his abdomen.&quot; 

She very tenderly pulled up his shirt to reveal the puncture wounds. Enzan groaned.</span>

The call tore it&#39;s namesake away from focusing on Enzan. Manabe looked over her shoulder to see the huddle now standing, wheels on the basket engaged. A tuft of mint hair behind one of their sides made it hard to focus. But she had to.

&quot;We don&#39;t have much time, I&#39;m not sure how much longer he&#39;ll hold on. He&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;Then take him to the helicopter! We&#39;re coming right behind you.&quot; Manabe whipped her head back quick, to see Enzan&#39;s bleeding stomach. The patches given to his legs would have to do. 

&quot;Enzan-kun, where is Searchman?&quot; She asked steadily as more of the wash was squirted out. He was soaked, it didn&#39;t matter. Pads and gauze came quickly after. &quot;Pen-kun will go get him, while I get you to the helicopter with L-laika.&quot;</span>

Pen pulled away from Enzan&#39;s hand, and stood up. She pulled Blues from her pocket. &quot;Here--&quot; The PET was pushed into Enzan&#39;s hand.  

&quot;I&#39;ll get them. You two get to the &#39;copter.&quot; Pen backed up, finding it hard to pull her eyes from Enzan. Once she did, she raced into the darkened room. Her own PET was at the ready. The sight of the damaged navis would have been breathtaking if she wasn&#39;t already teetering over the chaos she had seen so far.</span>

&quot;Come on, come on...&quot; She sought to assure Enzan instead if calling out. &quot;Do your best to walk. Pen will follow us. She&#39;ll cover our backs.&quot;

With the team of medics gone, the building was eeriely silent. Each scuff and crunch of boots and shoes could be heard bouncing off the bare concrete. Such a noisy retreat masked the sounds of the electronics upstairs. Their whirring and buzzing, increasing, fell on deaf ears. What the steps could not mask was the breath of air that seemed to grace Manabe and Enzan for a moment. A single metallic click sounded. It was like a ghost passing by, and air felt electric in it&#39;s wake. 

In the room Pen discovered, Searchman stood out in the center of the racks. The imposter had rigged a crude hologram to show off just how he lost. His form was listing, shoved to the side by a force to the head. The navimark over his right hearing receptor was starting to shatter. Whatever had frozen him did so miliseconds before any lethal blow. 

Cords ran from the hologram&#39;s base, down the sides of the shelves and onto the floor with the others. They flowed out of the room, only to be tucked up into a wall just before the exit.</span>

&quot;Here we go.&quot; She poked her hand into the hole in the wall, to see which way the cords led. To the right. 

Penelope swung around the doorframe, only to slam headfirst into an invisible force. She reeled back, clutching a bleeding nose.

&quot;What the fuck?&quot;</span>

The rumble of a voice came from just overhead, from the air. In the next second, the mystery revealed itself. The air began to twist and change into a figure, a grand radial disc overshadowing Pen&#39;s stance. Red eyes glowed and look downward, as a ruby rifle reached out to the floor.

Countershade. 

&quot;<em>Humans be reeeal fragile, don&#39;t they?</em>&quot; he continued as he lifted up his weapon. It pointed past Pen, to a target of two over her shoulder. &quot;<em>I can hittem from here.

&quot;I&#39;ll play. Whatever you want.&quot; She was steady, no hesitation. &quot;You like games? I&#39;m much more fun.&quot; Every word was packed with the thought, focus here, bring it down to me. Forget them. The others mean nothing, they are just background noise.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The quick answer gave Countershade a grin. Sharp teeth broke through the shadows he casted. His rifle lowered. 

Just then, Manabe looked back to check. Horror struck her as she spotted the surreal figure just beyond the door. Enzan&#39;s weight reminded her she couldn&#39;t say a word. Whether it was a hologram or a copyroid, there was still a large <em>threat</em> on this island. One that rocked the hopes of Laika&#39;s survival. 

She picked up the pace, forcing Enzan to stumble along faster. They were almost there. But Pen... Pen!

&quot;<em>Lil&#39; Missy, after t&#39; hell I&#39;ve been through on this rock, y&#39; better hope that yer fun.</em>&quot; Countershade grumbled. &quot;<em>But yer not going back on that helicopter. Once it takes off... I gots the means to start us off proper. Better say yet farewells.</em>&quot;

As if predicted, Manabe&#39;s voice rang into Pen&#39;s ear. 

&quot;There&#39;s a second helicopter on the way to properly investigate the place. They took off soon after we did.&quot; She was vague, because of who she was in earshot of. &quot;What&#39;s your status?&quot;</span>

She watched them leave. In the last seconds they were in the doorway, she heard Enzan&#39;s protest-- of course, he was too smart not to realize something was off. 

<em>&quot;No! You can&#39;t let this continue, we can&#39;t leave her alone!&quot;</em>  Enzan&#39;s voice trailed off, into the stormy weather. 

Pen&#39;s shoulders fell. They were out of range, out of danger. The boys would live, and their suffering could finally end. One way or another.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Manabe kept Enzan on course, pain evident on her face. She guided him into the helicopter as the engines roared. They were both met with a sight unwanted. All the tubes, wrappings, and hastily working hands... Laika wouldn&#39;t survive the flight without them. He might not even survive with them. It finally forced something out of Manabe. A shuddering breath broke through her firm exterior. Apologies came through the radio, until the sound of take off cut them out. Between them, Manabe squeezed out one final order. 

&quot;Penelope, make him regret-&quot;

The helicopter faded away, and quiet returned to the island. The sea churned with howling winds and whipping rain. Inside the building, two figures stood still. 

&quot;<em>I believe I&#39;ve waited long enough.</em>&quot; Countershade enthused, moving suddenly. He rolled his shoulders, bent his neck side to side. &quot;<em>You gotta solve a lil&#39; conundrum I got.</em>&quot;

His form flickered, and vanished. Left behind was a copyroid, well used. It clattered to the floor, just as the computers upstairs roared into action. A bright light flash outside, forcing the rain to stop as color and hum returned to the island. 

&quot;<em>Yer mangy mutt&#39;s original Navi is kept safe on those computers upstairs!</em>&quot; Countershade&#39;s voice echoed from outside. There was gunfire after as he howled with laughter. &quot;<em>But so am I! And I ain&#39;t killed easy lil&#39; Missy!</em>&quot;

Red bullets bounced around as warning, yet one flung itself into the corridor where Pen stood. Their bout had begun.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">&quot;Penelope!&quot; Role shouted, the moment the dimensional area activated. Penelope pushed in her synchro chip in the same moment. A bright flash enveloped her. Role&#39;s strength wrapped around her limbs, deflecting everything around them. 

R Role&#39;s form had just settled, when the first bullet screamed past their head. R Role calmly ducked to the left, and slammed their black boot down onto the Copyroid. The chest caved, and the core shattered. Electricity spilled out onto the floor in a fountain of sparks. They tromped out, boots heavy against the old tile and crumbling infrastructure.

They activated a bamboo sword-- their hair blazed out behind their helmet. They had no intention of hiding. 

<em>&quot;We find the source of the dimensional area, before he kills us.&quot;</em> 
<em>&quot;Or we delete him, and then destroy the computer he runs to.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;Or both.&quot;</em>

R Role ran upstairs first. They had no qualms destroying walls to find it. Rubble from what they destroyed with their sword bounced off an old cot. The smell of blood and medical supplies hit their nose. They closed their visor. Their scanner identified all the electronics in the room. No PETs, just the old computer.</span>

&quot;<em>Ya just goin&#39; to decimate him &#39;long with me?! I was assumin&#39; Searchman was important!</em>&quot; he hollered. &quot;<em>Only thing y&#39; can do up there is destroy evidence. No dimensional controls, no nothin&#39;! Now get down here, lil&#39; Missy! We supposed to be havin&#39; fun!</em>&quot;

He followed up with words with a volley, breaking the windows on the room with bullets. They danced precariously around, like red ropes cutting R Role off from destroying anything more.</span>

They surveyed the room one more time for proof to Countershade&#39;s claims. They faced away from the computer and bullets. &quot;Pawn.&quot; 

A pawn battle chip activated, placing a sentinal in the doorway. With that set, she moved to the window, and leaped down in the direction the bullets had come from. She aimed for where she hoped Countershade&#39;s head was. Smoke and a smoldering tree rested below her. Her weight smashed the wood and char to bits, pushing deep into the muddy ground. She sank down to the ankle in muck. 

&quot;We&#39;re ready to play.&quot; 

Visibility in the woods was low, but it added a soupiness to the air that she hoped to use to identify the enemy with. Enzan had certainly raised hell here in a short amount of time.</span>

&quot;<em>I&#39;m glad. Glad y&#39; listened.</em>&quot; Countershade hissed through his teeth. His words were as sharp as his teeth. &quot;<em>Now, you best watch your back!</em>&quot;

In that moment, a red bullet whizzed past R Role&#39;s head, with several more following behind it. Countershade vanished before they could hit. He looked to regain the advantage in the wet smoke. His voice came out of the air, from all sides.

&quot;<em>Are y&#39; as quick as that Blues fella?!</em>&quot;</span>

She swung it hard, intercepting as many of the bullets as she could. They bounced off of it, flinging in a wide arch around her. Red streaks rushed into the felled trees for their final destination. A bullet skimmed her thigh just below the hip, and she didn&#39;t even flinch. 

Her other arm flung sonic booms, filling in the spaces between bullets.</span>

Now that the bullets were out of his plan, they were as much as a danger to him as they were R Role. One snuck under his disc, hitting his shoulder. A small grunt accompanied the pain, but it was barely a hint towards his location. 

He whipped out his rifle and fired off another volley. Red, several reds, and lastly a blue. They bounced around in chaos, threatening to hit one another as they passed. The trees helped the endeavor. They helped make a trap for the second opponent. 

&quot;<em>Ya can&#39;t just hit &#39;em all away!</em>&quot; Countershade bellowed, further away now. &quot;<em>Some don&#39;t like it! Or meybe they like it a bit to much! Hah!</em>&quot;</span>

She hardly had time to process Countershade&#39;s words before the blue bullet was screaming towards her head. 

She raised her hammer for a volley instead of a swing, hoping to lessen the impact. The blue bullet pushed her back, before exploding right in front of her. 

Flames and waveshockes of energy split through the remaining trees, leaving only wasteland. From the explosion rose the Salamander fire, an enormous dragon with Role at the center. They swooped down over the land, aiming in the general direction of Countershade&#39;s last known location.</span>

Countershade did not yell out with them. He kept up from the forest, marking himself by the quick hole in the smoke. There was no chance to get as high as R Role, but she could still be in range. Singed, he held up his other arm. The elbow bent unnaturally, opening up a deadly chamber.

&quot;<em>Yer just gonna burn us all t&#39;hell at this rate!</em>&quot; he bellowed before being cut off by machine gun fire.</span>

They summoned up a Zeus hammer. This could be dangerous for anyone touching the ground nearby, so Role was sure to scan for life nearby. She raced closer to where Countershade had been standing, tracing bullet patterns and movements in the smoke. 

When she was sure she was close enough, she jumped up, and slammed the hammer into the ground. It was as if an earthquake had struck.</span>

The sudden boom and trembling earth caught Countershade off guard. He was tossed around into uneasy footing, unable to work out a way to safety. Dirt shot up, bringing with it rocks and large sections of the forest floor. It clipped his dish before he could get away.

The damage disabled his camoflauge, forcing him to stick out like a sore thumb in the heated browns and reds of chaos around him.

Their other arm turned silver, and they punched with that as well. &quot;Stay down! You <em>fucking</em> darkloid!&quot; This THING may have killed Laika! Their hair blazed brighter, and they punched again. Punch, punch, punch-- until their battle chips ran out, and they were punching with their bare hands. 

Their arm and chest were in tatters, ripped to shreds by bullets. When the chaos cleared, they realized they had been yelling. 

&quot;Gh- hhgh--&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Countershade just kept on grinning skyward. The smashed arm didn&#39;t matter, the smashed leg didn&#39;t matter. Her punches putting dents into his dish didn&#39;t seem to matter whatsoever! He sharp teeth stayed bare through it all.

The bare fists struck numb compared to all her other hits. Countershade was immobilized after the onslaught. Whatever was next would be the last.

&quot;<em>Th-that&#39;s the thing, lil Missy.</em>&quot; he wheezed.  His head flopped to the side as all the power blitzed through him was finally catching up. &quot;<em>I won&#39;t stay down. Can&#39;t- ggh- even if I wanted ta&#39;.</em>&quot;</span>

I&#39;ll pull you from your purgatory, Darkloid. This will be your last battle.&quot; They raised their less damaged hand, &quot;Fishy!&quot; A virus materialized above, so they could jump on. They collapsed on it&#39;s back, barely holding tight. It flew straight for the open window they had placed the Pawn at. 

They tucked and rolled, into the window. The collision with the building made the Fishy disappear. R Role stood up from the disgusting cot, and stumbled to the computer. 

<em>Save... and disconnect. Just need the hard drive in one piece.</em> Role knew what to do, even if Pen didn&#39;t. With the computer off, it wouldn&#39;t be able to continue on re-awakening the Countershade backup file.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">The grin vanished as R Role rode off. No movement came to try and attack her while her back was turned. Countershade&#39;s eyes were wide as they followed her form, and slid close to listen to his sixth sense once she could no longer be seen. He couldn&#39;t move, and the state was so quickly gained that systems were still trying to process it all. 

&quot;<em>G-ggghhh--</em>&quot; He groaned. &quot;<em>W-won&#39;t even, listen to the whole tale. S0... rud€.</em>&quot;

Coughing became corroded along with his words. Countershade forced himself to sit up. He glanced around at sorry sights. Rifle, limbs, all smashed to bits. The stubs he used to get this far sparked with resistance. His head permanently leaned to one side, the smashed disc on his head skewing the balance he knew.

                    <span class="markdown">R Role yanked the power cord, and tenderly gathered the computer into their arms. There was now the problem of the dimensional area. No one was around to turn it off. The idea of being stranded here for any period of time was alarming, mostly because from the mission records, Regal&#39;s plans tended to blow up in the end. Literally. 

While they gathered the old cord up, the building rumbled. All their attacks before had done a number on the place. 

They jumped out the window, and moved inland. The spot they&#39;d left Countershade in was bare. While they would stay on guard and wary... they&#39;d done such a number on him, he was surely deleted. The scarred landscape felt peaceful now, less dangerous. Though, it was a harsh reminder of the dangers that had migrated home.

R Role collapsed in an exhausted heap beside a charred tree stump. The wounds across their arm and chest were painful enough to consider uncrossing. However, the comfort of each other&#39;s minds was too important. They tilted their head up to watch the colors of the dimensional area. Just a little longer. All there was left to do... was wait.</span>
