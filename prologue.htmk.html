This Yugi was a bit taller, and his eyes looked a bit more tired. His desk was a mess of paperwork and at least 3 different planners, and a calendar with a ton of sticky-notes and colors on it. Other than that, most of everything was the same. He still lived above the game store, and he was still him. 

When the smaller Yugi appeared, he couldn&#39;t help but wince. Pain struck up the right side of his head. He begged his own psyche to just leave him be for a few. 

&quot;...Hey,&quot; He said, trying a smile. Suddenly he felt nervous- which he found strange. This was just high school him. Why was he worried? <em>You are in a position of power over him.</em> 

Please shut up, he begged again. The presence didn&#39;t leave.</span>

He sniffed. “Hey.” He stared down at his hands, tapped his fingers together. 

Shyly, he looked up at his older self. He tried to smile, too. It was nice to meet another version of himself without his head feeling like it was going to split in half, but… Yugi didn’t think he was here for happy reasons.

“It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me.” He ends up repeating himself. “I just… I don’t want him to leave…”</span>

The tears in his smaller self&#39;s eyes made him just want to pick him up and hug him as tight as he could, to tell him everything in the worst detail. To tell him how strong he would be. To tell him how they would win in the end. 

But that meant talking about the end. 

Yugi reached out and gestured for him to come sit. He let him sit up on his bed, and Yugi opted to sit in his desk chair. &quot;I know. I know. I&#39;m sorry those two got you worried.&quot;

But he hadn&#39;t confirmed nor denied it. He glanced at the pill bottles on his desk. What should he say? Be honest with himself, or shield over the truth? 

<em>Atem,</em> he heard inside his mind. <em>Atem is here.</em>

Yugi didn&#39;t want to awknowledge that. That their puzzle wasn&#39;t a fake one, and the soul inside was definitely...him. That was something they just couldn&#39;t breach. 

He had to break this tension. Nothing was ever going to come out at this rate. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what you wanna know. But- mmm,&quot; he smiled. &quot;You are way ahead of me. I didn&#39;t tell him as early as you did. Are you two-?&quot; His smile turned to a grin as he gestured. &quot;Together?&quot;

Yami appeared beside his Yugi, his arm around him a bit protectively. He didn&#39;t respond, didn&#39;t comment. His eyes were locked onto the older Yugi. Like he was determining if he was a threat or not.</span>

He perked up at the question. Wiped the tears out of his eyes. He looked up at Yami with a grin. “We’re together. I’ve never been happier, he… He makes me really happy. I love him, and he loves me.”

They loved each other. So why would Yami ever leave…? Yugi didn’t want him to. He was sure Yami didn’t want to, either. They were happy, couldn’t this last forever?</span>

Yugi could...see him. Yugi wasn&#39;t sure if he should let it on. He knew it was because of the puzzle, but...maybe that meant that this Yugi wasn&#39;t like him. Which made things worse. That meant the end <em>was</em> the end for him. 

He didn&#39;t let it show. He smiled and leaned back. &quot;I&#39;m surprised he got it out there. He was always emotionally constipated.&quot;

<em>I simply did not have the words.</em> His own Yami argued. He could see his own out of the corner of his eye- but it wasn&#39;t like the other Yugi&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t a spirit, or a projection- just a form, a way for him to compartmentalize everything. 

<em>&quot;I simply did not have the words, yet.&quot;</em> Yami murmured, kissing Yugi&#39;s cheek when he got the chance. <em>&quot;I do love you.&quot;</em>

Yugi saw his mouth move, but he couldn&#39;t hear his words. Only went so far, he thought.</span>

He turned his attention back to the other Yugi. “We got together before you did? How long have you been together, then?” 

If that was different, how much was different between them? How different was his future from this Yugi’s present?</span>

&quot;...Maybe a month?&quot; He looked away, &quot;Actually, uh-&quot; He glanced at his calendar. &quot;In a few weeks it&#39;ll be a month.&quot; A nervous laugh wheezed out.

<em>&quot;What.&quot;</em> Yami couldn&#39;t help but blink, and Yugi had to fight himself to not react to his look. <em>&quot;What do you mean, a month? He is much older than you.&quot;</em> He looked down at his own Yugi. How could another version of himself hold onto these feelings for so long, and not say anything?</span>

He looked up from his hands. “So you’ve just held back these feelings this whole time? Or…” Or were the feelings a recent development for the older Yugi? Maybe he hadn’t felt this way as long.</span>

His curiosity got the better of him, though. “It’s different?” He stopped himself from asking how. The other Yugi couldn’t tell him everything, and this might be one of those things. He had to respect that. “Well, if you’re together, that’s good. Whatever’s different, it can’t be that bad if you still have him.”</span>

The road back to his partner was not easy- hell, they hadn&#39;t even gotten to their destination. Doctors appointments and adjusting his lifestyle, and...it was a bit like when it all started. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure how to say this without it coming off...a way,&quot; He laughed again, though it was nervous and strung out. He started to worry at his wrists, rubbing them. He hadn&#39;t even told his folks. Now he had to tell his younger self, which was basically a stranger to him now. &quot;Uhm, so, for me- I&#39;m not saying this is the same for you- my other self has...always been there. Even when I was young. I just didn&#39;t know until I solved the puzzle.&quot; 

He glanced at the model of the puzzle on his desk. It was very convincing, but he was sure that Yugi would be able to see its imperfections. &quot;We were unable to talk for a while, after some stuff happened. About a month ago, I started blacking out again. Uh, turns out, he was...Trying to say...hello?&quot;

If trying to say hello was beating the shit out of random people, scaring his friends, and being mildly delusional, yeah. Yeah, that was his &quot;hello&quot;.</span>

Trying to process what he was being told.

“…Your partner’s always been there?” So, their Yami had been there before solving the puzzle. He looked up at his Yami. “I thought you’ve only been here since I solved the puzzle. Have you been here longer? I…”

Thinking about it gave him a headache, the pain centering around the left side of the back of his head. 

Should he ask what happened to the other Yugi, to make him unable to talk to his Yami? It sounded private. If the other Yugi wanted to bring it up, he would, but maybe it was best to leave the subject alone.</span>

Yugi wasn&#39;t sure how to phrase it. He fidgeted, mirroring the younger Yugi, his hands tapping on his knee. &quot;It&#39;s probably not the same for you. I&#39;m a different case, hah.&quot; He looked away, trying to figure out how to say it all over again. He saw his own Yami standing near his closet, and blinked the vision away. &quot;I didn&#39;t know he was there, either. But I solved the puzzle, and then, well- he was there.&quot;

Maybe this was a way to phrase it. &quot;My partner can&#39;t...er...Play shadow games anymore. When we got...separated, for a bit, when he came back, it&#39;s not something he can do anymore.&quot; That said nothing. Ugh, why was this so hard. He looked at his puzzle again, and grabbed up the model. 

&quot;This isn&#39;t the puzzle...It&#39;s a model of it. I don&#39;t have the Millennium Puzzle anymore.&quot; He showed it to Yugi, holding it out for him to look at. It <em>was</em> very well made, it was extremely close to the real thing. But someone like Yugi would be able to see the slight imperfections. &quot;We had to leave it somewhere important. So I have this now.&quot;</span>

“Not the puzzle…” Yes, he could see the differences between the two.

When he went to set the model down, his fingers brushed against it. 

Suddenly the pain in his head spiked, and he winced, his right eye squeezing shut. He seemed to freeze for a few moments, not saying anything, his eyes shut tightly. 

When he opened again, there was just something <em>different</em> about him. And he looked at the Yugi sitting on his bed with wide eyes...except, he was looking just beyond him. 

Yami blinked back. <em>&quot;Can he...See me...?&quot;</em>

&quot;J-JOEY!&quot; He suddenly shouted, which made Yami stumble back. There was a crash, stumble, then loud footsteps before his door was swung open. &quot;Wh-&quot;

And there was Joey, looking at two Yugis. There was a moment of silence before Joey grumbled. Yeah, this may as well be fuckin&#39; happening. &quot;Hey- Yami, what the fuck?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; He snapped back. Didn&#39;t know? He was just talking to them. &quot;He&#39;s- At-&quot;

As Joey rushed in, though, he uncovered them. Sure, he was older, but he recognized his best friend right away. He smiled awkwardly at Joey.

“Yeah. I’m Yugi.” Good job, Joey already probably figured that one out. “Nice to meet you too? What just happened? Why doesn’t he…”

Why did the other Yugi just yell for Joey? Why didn’t the other Yugi know what just happened? What was going on? Sure, he heard Joey say ‘Yami’, but the other Yugi wasn’t wearing the puzzle. It didn’t make any sense.</span>

Yami made a face. But he got up and left the room. Running water could be heard. Joey sighed and looked at the younger Yugi. &quot;He just er...&quot; Shoot, how much did he know? Why the hell was the little guy even here? He assumed Yugi knew, but his Yugi was checked right out. Well, if he was about to fuck up, it wasn&#39;t his fault. Yugi&#39;s fault for inviting people to their house that looked just like him without even dropping a line. &quot;He switched, that&#39;s all. It&#39;s Yami now. You uh, you get that, right?&quot;

Joey looked over at his desk, and grabbed an orange bottle off of it. He shook a pill from it. &quot;Yami? Do you need your meds?&quot; 

Yami reappeared at the door, a towel over his face. He grumbled in wordless reply. &quot;It&#39;s here if you need it, buddy.&quot; 

Yami took the desk chair again, but moved it so he was behind Joey. Joey looked back to the younger one, setting the medicine on the table. &quot;So- uh, what brings you...here?&quot;</span>

&quot;But I can chat with ya. Do you like ice cream? I&#39;m getting tired of being cooped up,&quot; He stretched. Food sounded good, made shit easier.

A yes or no answer kind of question.” If the other Yami really could see his partner, that was…interesting? He didn’t know what to make of it.

He giggled. “You’re like a giant, Joey! Ice cream sounds good.” Ice cream was pleasant and calming, and he could really use calm right now.</span>

Joey grinned. Good. &quot;Do you know where your shoes are?&quot; 

&quot;Downstairs, next to the coat tree.&quot; Joey gave him a thumbs up. &quot;Good work. Go get ready.&quot; 

Yami went, his steps down the stairs slow and careful. He looked back at the younger Yugi. &quot;He&#39;s still figuring things out. I help him out a lot. You can ask him when we get out. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll warm up to you.&quot; He gestured for Yugi to follow him downstairs. The store was just the same- closed for now, since it was late enough in the day. Yami had tied his hair back, and was wearing a jacket and his shoes. Sweet, Joey thought, they&#39;re on the right feet. 

Yami still stared at the two of them, nearly glaring. Joey waved his hand in front of his face. &quot;C&#39;mon buddy. Let&#39;s stop staring at the kid, he&#39;s cool.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s me.&quot; &quot;Yeah, he is. It&#39;s not the first time there&#39;s been another you.&quot; Yami frowned at Joey. &quot;I&#39;ve got it handled. Be nice.&quot; 

Yami stopped looking, shoving his hands in the jacket and walking ahead of Joey. &quot;Oh- jeez, he doesn&#39;t know where he&#39;s going, hold on-&quot; And there Joey went, rushing after him. They sure were...a pair.</span>

He giggled again, watching Joey run after Yami. They were so funny. The future couldn’t be that bad if Joey was here, still his best friend. Maybe he shouldn’t worry so much.

He walked after them at a moderately fast pace, not wanting to run but not wanting to be left behind.</span>

&quot;I dunno what he told ya. But uhh, well, Yuge goes to university now, he&#39;s all fancy and shit. He&#39;s in his second year and, uhh...&quot; He looked at Yugi, thinking over what he should say. He still had the puzzle and looked, well, a bit...innocent?

&quot;He does art.&quot; Yami said, his tone flat. 

&quot;Oh- yeah, tha&#39;s one of the things he does. Art and, uh, marketing, and...&quot;

&quot;Games.&quot; Yami filled in. &quot;Yeah, that. He&#39;s a busy guy.&quot;

They arrived at the little ice cream stand just a few blocks away from the store. Joey didn&#39;t even need to ask what Yami wanted, he already knew- plain vanilla, in a cone. But not the cake cones, because they had a terrible texture. He called the other ones &quot;the toasted cones&quot;. Always had been that way. He looked back at Yugi. &quot;Whatcha want? My treat.&quot;

Yami had wandered to stand beside the other Yami, who was looking very uncomfortable. Being stared at like this was <em>not</em> usual.</span>

He looked over the ice cream flavors. He’d been to this ice cream stand before, in his own time, but the flavors were different. They must have changed. He paused at the description of one that sounded good. “Fly fishing? Yeah, that sounds good. In a regular cone.”

He looked from Joey to Yami to his partner. Okay, this was getting really weird.</span>

And he <em>could.</em>

&quot;Can hear you too.&quot; He muttered, before turning and taking his cone from Joey, who hadn&#39;t seen the exchange. He went to the little tables nearby and sat, enjoying his cone. Joey gestured to join him, handing off Yugi&#39;s cone. When they were seated, Joey made sure that Yami didn&#39;t make a damn mess- he just washed that jacket- and resumed the previous conversation. 

&quot;Yugi flunked a ton in high school. We were busy a lot,&quot; Joey shrugged. &quot;He made it work. Always did. He got his mind set to something and he would go for it.&quot;

The vision of Yami was beside Yugi, touching his own hair. He looked absolutely bewildered. Not even Yugi could touch him that clearly. What the hell just happened? And here Joey was all casual. 

&quot;What&#39;s your life like right now? I don&#39;t know where ya...fall, I guess?&quot;</span>

His mind went blank with panic. Wordlessly, he took his ice cream from Joey and sat down. He reached out to hold his partner’s free hand as he took a bite of ice cream.

Ice cream was kind of a magical thing. It made everything better. He calmed down a bit. As long as Yami didn’t hurt his partner, it was probably fine. Right?

“I’m in high school, still. Tenth grade. Taking classes. You, Anzu, and Honda are still my friends, of course. And I have my partner!” He turned towards his partner briefly with a smile. “Lately… The puzzle’s wanted my partner to search for his memories, but he doesn’t want that. We’re happy just being together.”</span>

Joey hadn&#39;t gotten an ice cream and was now regretting it. But, eh, he was enjoying the afternoon air and the quiet of the street. Late enough that it wasn&#39;t busy around here. And it was kind of nice to talk to this Yugi...nostalgic. 

&quot;You two uhh-&quot; He gestured. He crossed his fingers. &quot;You two a thing? They are. However tha&#39; works.&quot;

Joey looked a bit surprised. It was more than Yami had spoken to anyone outside of his immediate friend group, and even then. And this was news to Joey. &quot;I didn&#39;t know tha&#39;. Huh.&quot;

He didn&#39;t miss a beat, though, flashing a typical grin. &quot;Good. At least ya figured it out early. These two are a joke, you&#39;d think after everything-&quot;

&quot;I did not have the correct words.&quot; Yami said, simply. &quot;Now I do. It is as simple as that.&quot;

<em>&quot;...We are alike,&quot;</em> Yami murmured. <em>&quot;...I am somehow...relieved? I cannot explain it.&quot;</em>

&quot;Well, its a damn good thing you&#39;ve found your words. You were talking with your fists for too long.&quot; Joey playfully pushed his shoulder, and Yami finally had a small smile on his face. He could recognize Joey&#39;s teasing well now.</span>

He watched Joey and Yami with a smile. They seemed like good friends, and both Yami and Joey deserved good friends.

“My partner found the right words before I got the courage to tell him. After I went to my Joey for advice and everything, too…”

He squeezed his partner’s hand. Solidarity between Yamis was a good thing.</span>

Yami didn&#39;t respond, looking at him with a raised eyebrow. Joey frowned. &quot;Fine, be that way.&quot; 

Yami looked back at the pair. &quot;Our place is formless. It is difficult. We have to...rebuild. We have been through many things. I lost myself, and had to find Yugi again.&quot; 

Joey subconsciously put his arm around Yami&#39;s shoulders. &quot;And I&#39;m glad to have him back. You two hold onto that, yeah? That everyone likes ya. Wants ya to be together.&quot;</span>

&quot;Yugi had to send me away.&quot; He said, finally. &quot;It was a choice that neither of us wanted to make...But it was the right move in the end. There may come a time where you must do the same. Have faith that you will be reunited.&quot;

Joey&#39;s expression fell. He took a breath in, then out. &quot;He&#39;s right. We had a lot of stuff happen. I dunno if it&#39;s right to tell you, but...&quot;

<em>&quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot;</em> Yami suddenly said. His eyes burned, and suddenly his third eye was glowing. <em>&quot;I will not leave his side. I do not care if the world is at stake. My role is with Yugi, my home is <strong>here.</strong>&quot;</em>

Yami looked at him, didn&#39;t say anything for a while. He winced, and suddenly turned to bury his face into Joey&#39;s jacket. &quot;Oh- hey, buddy, it&#39;s alright. You tired?&quot; Yami nodded, not speaking. &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot;

Joey looked back at Yugi. &quot;He might switch out in a minute. It&#39;s alrigh&#39;.&quot; His hand came up to shield the light from Yami&#39;s face. &quot;He might be remembering it all. But- it&#39;s like he said, y&#39;know. Everything works out in the end. If it ain&#39;t good, it ain&#39;t the end yet, y&#39;know?&quot;</span>

He couldn’t diagnose himself without knowing what it was, however. He knew what the word ‘identity’ meant. ‘Dissociative’ was more difficult, and putting them together was just extremely confusing.</span>

When Joey said he was a good duelist, Yugi believed it. How much had the card game changed over the years? Challenging Joey to a duel was almost certainly a bad idea.</span>

But he trusted in his partner. Yugi was right. Nothing had to change. He trailed behind Joey and Yugi, holding Yugi&#39;s hand loosely. A smile played on his face too. 

&quot;We carry a lotta duel monsters now. And we host tournaments every weekend.&quot; Joey explained, adjusting his hold on Yami. &quot;Yami judges, actually. He makes sure everyone follows the rules. He really likes it...Even though he scares the shit out of people. Hah.&quot;

Joey loved the store. He loved his life. You could tell he was so happy and proud of what he had, now. &quot;Get this- KaibaCorp certified the store. So we hold <em>official</em> tournaments. Keeps us pretty comfortable. Ain&#39;t that fuckin&#39; crazy? Kaiba, of all people.&quot;

There was a quiet mumble. &quot;L...anguage.&quot; And then he was snoring again.</span>

“Tournaments, huh?” He looked up at his partner. “I can see him liking that. Maybe if we ever hold tournaments, my partner could judge, too.”

He blinked. “Kaiba?” Kaiba certified the store?? That was harder to believe. “How did he go from Death-T to certifying Grandpa’s store? He lets you guys run official tournaments?”

He suppressed a giggle at Yami’s comment.</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Judging, Yami wondered...It would be a different experience. He wasn&#39;t sure. But, he was willing to try. And it made him feel so warm, to think Yugi was considering him in his future. 

Joey laughed. &quot;Ohh, hell...Death-T was, er...shit, a long ass time ago. Around six years or so, I think. And a lot happened in six years.&quot;

They got closer to the store. Yami seemed to stir, blinking harshly. He turned his face into Joey, not wanting to be awake yet. &quot;I mean, I ain&#39;t ever gonna forgive the bastard. But I&#39;m not an idiot. He&#39;s...Done a lotta good these days. Especially for Yugi, believe it or not.&quot;

He couldn&#39;t forget what Kaiba had done for him, when Yugi was getting diagnosed. Under any other circumstances, Yugi would have gotten in a lot of trouble. And Kaiba didn&#39;t have much of a reason to be kind to him- but he chose to anyway. And there still hadn&#39;t been a medical bill in the mail. That, Joey thought, was good enough for him. 

They returned to the store. Joey fussed with the keys before opening up, turning on the lights as they entered. He took a quick detour to drop Yami off on the couch, covering him in his favorite couch-blanket (some blankets were specific to where they were). He came back, sighed, stretching out. &quot;Man that guy&#39;s heavy.&quot;

He walked over to the counter, smiling at Yugi. This was fun, actually. Getting to see this version of his best friend reminded him of all the work they had done to get here. &quot;Take a look around. Like I said, it&#39;s a lotta Duel Monsters now.&quot;

Yami was already wandering about the store, his eyes wide as he looked at all of the displays. There were cards he didn&#39;t recognize, art he didn&#39;t recognize on them. It was exciting. Yugi would surely be feeling how his heart was beating faster at it all.</span>

Once they were in the store and Yami was settled, Yugi began to run around the store. Yami’s excitement was infectious. As he looked, he kept a running commentary on the cards he looked at.

“I’ve never seen a white card before!” “Whoa, this art looks really cool!” “What’s this one do?” “Did they change how Ritual cards work?” “I’ve seen this one before!”

At one point, he ended up next to his partner. He grinned. “Partner, Grandpa’s store is so cool in the future!”</span>

&quot;It&#39;s his, too.&quot; Joey pointed to the back, leading to where Yami was snoozing. &quot;He has co-ownership now. Works here pretty much all the time when he&#39;s not at school.&quot;

Yami marveled at Joey for a moment. <em>Partner,</em> he murmured. <em>That sounds nice. I would like a future like that, with you.</em> He took Yugi&#39;s hand, giving it a squeeze. Despite what seemed to be some struggle...They all looked so happy. Content. This world was so full of wonder. And new cards, which were just a bonus.</span>

He squeezed his partner’s hand back. “I’d like a future like that with you, too, partner… 

Seeing this future this Yugi, Yami, and Joey had soothed his heart. Those horrible things he was told about in the chatroom were so far away now, nothing to worry about or fear. Their future wasn’t darkness and power. 

The future Yugi would work towards was full of happiness and light.</span>

Joey seemed to read his mind, because the look he gave him spoke volumes. Yugi sighed. &quot;Uhm- why don&#39;t you come sit with me on the couch? I&#39;ll, uh, explain what he meant about the, uh, disorder thing. I guess you have a right to know.&quot;</span>

No, Yugi had a way better guess, but he couldn&#39;t say that. Just couldn&#39;t put <em>everything</em> out there. Joey gave him a thumbs up before they moved to the side room, where Yugi had been snoozing before. He sighed, and sat there. How to start...

&quot;Uh. Well, I imagine Yami told you, er...Well, I don&#39;t know what he told you, so, I&#39;ll start from the beginning. I&#39;m not saying this is what you&#39;re going through- remember, you&#39;re not like those people in the chat, and that means you may not be like me, either. &quot;

<em>They fit the bill.</em> He willed his mind to be quiet. &quot;You might have heard this called, er, split personality. But it&#39;s called different now. And, uh, it means, that there&#39;s something that happened to me when I was younger, and it made my head make two of me. So there&#39;s me,&quot; He gestured to himself. &quot;I&#39;m Yugi. I like playing games, I go to school...&quot;

Then, he gestured. It happened to be in the direction of the vision of Yami. 

&quot;Then there&#39;s Yami. He&#39;s the other part of me. He comes out when I&#39;m stressed, and he protects me from being hurt by others. He&#39;s more confident than I am, when he&#39;s doing something he knows how to do.&quot;

<em>This is something they already know.</em> Yugi knew he was right. &quot;So I&#39;ve been like this forever. Yami has been with me forever. I only became aware of it when I solved the puzzle. So, even though I don&#39;t have it anymore, he&#39;s still here...Cause he and I are apart of the same person. It&#39;s a mental thing? I see a lot of doctors over it. They do studies on me, and stuff. When I get anxious I take medicine. That&#39;s about it, ah...&quot;

There was more. So much more he could talk about- the blackouts, the damage he had been doing before he realized what was happening. The longing for his old friend...Atem. But he kept his mouth shut. &quot;...Questions?&quot; He asked, a little sheepishly.</span>

He…

He had a bad headache. Listening to this made the left side of his head <em>hurt</em>, why did his head hurt? 

He tried to push the pain away, ignore it. Now wasn’t the time for this.

“So your head…made two of you…and you’ve always been like this. He’s always been there…”

He wasn’t sure what to make of it all. 

“How do I know if I have it?” Yugi asked quietly. “Should I go see a doctor?”</span>

His own head spiked with pain, up his right side. His right eye twitched. Ugh. <em>Why do you keep lying to him?</em> 

&quot;I&#39;m not trying to-&quot; He snapped out loud, before covering his mouth. &quot;Ugh- I&#39;m sorry. Yami said something to me. I&#39;m not used to not talking to him out loud.&quot;

The younger Yami had moved forward, and wrapped his arms around his Yugi, sitting beside him on the couch. His hand rubbed a calming circle into his side, as best as he could like this. <em>&quot;Even if that is the case,&quot;</em> He said, <em>&quot;Nothing changes between you and me, partner. We are still as we were. We will brave anything that comes our way.&quot;</em>

&quot;Due to your...circumstances, I wouldn&#39;t try to go ask doctors about it. You&#39;ve got some...things to figure out, with that puzzle.&quot; He pointed at it. &quot;You&#39;ll know when that&#39;s all over. And then you can look into all that, alright?&quot;</span>

But, his partner had a point. Even if he had the disorder, nothing had really changed. They still had each other, and that’s all that mattered.

&quot;Say,&quot; He asked. &quot;When you aren&#39;t wearing the puzzle...Can you still hear your partner?&quot;

Yami blinked, looking over at the older Yugi. What was he thinking? They hadn&#39;t been able to see each other when it was broken or taken off. Why would it be different?</span>

“Partner, I… I felt you holding my hand… Without the puzzle… I…”

So he couldn’t see his partner without the puzzle, but he could feel his touch? What did that mean? He couldn’t stop himself from crying.</span>

It felt like he blinked, and then the world had changed, and he was trying to comfort his partner. And his head ached so badly. He couldn&#39;t help but shoot a confused, somewhat frustrated look at the older Yugi. He tried to hold onto Yugi as tight as this form would allow. <em>&quot;It&#39;s alright, partner. It&#39;s alright. As I said before, nothing will change. We are as we were. I will always be by your side.&quot;</em>

Yugi was giving Joey a <em>hey, I fucked up</em> signal. Joey kind of half shrugged in return, a <em>what do you want me to do about it forehead, you got us into this mess</em> kind of look. 

And then he winced again. And Yami turned back to look at the younger Yugi. 

&quot;So you may have it.&quot; He murmured. His hand raised to rest on his shoulder. &quot;If this is the case, you have always been this way. You do not need to be afraid.&quot;</span>

Yami looked to Joey, then back. &quot;He is correct.&quot;

The younger Yami, however, was feeling his own chest tighten. If they were a part of each other- then, was it right for them to be together? <em>Did</em> it change things. He wanted to be strong for Yugi, but worries started to cloud his own thoughts. He didn&#39;t voice them, holding his tongue. He had to be strong. He held Yugi&#39;s hand just, that much tighter (as much as he could).</span>

Yami sat, looking at his hands. He felt a bit of guilt. The younger version of Yugi looked so much like his partner, spoke so much like him... He wanted to hug him, much like he wanted to hug his own partner. 

&quot;Yugi,&quot; he mumbled. It was the first time he had called him by name. &quot;I am sorry that this information weighs heavily on your heart. I did not mean to. I am learning to become...human. Sometimes I say things I do not mean. I should not have so callously implied what could be happening to you.&quot;

He shifted. &quot;You both remind me of how it used to be. You should cherish this. I would have given anything to have told my partner my feelings so long ago, instead of sitting with them in my heart.&quot;</span>

The older Yami kept looking at his hands. &quot;I had been convinced I was dead, for a while.&quot; His voice was quiet. It was less like before, where it was a clear effort to force out any kind of confidence. It sounded the same way the other Yami did, soft and rumbling from his chest. &quot;And I was convinced I was in some terrible place, being tortured by visions of my friends, who I no longer was to see. I lashed out, trying to fight against my circumstance. Some days, I wonder if I am, still. But...&quot;

He finally glanced over. &quot;The road always led back to my partner. I can see your happiness. It is a pure thing. Never let it go. Even when your mind may play tricks upon you, when others are trying to harm you. You will always be guided back...home.&quot;

He didn&#39;t have much time to let it sit. Joey came back in, holding a rolled up futon in his arms and a few blankets and pillows. &quot;I suppose we&#39;re lucky your folks are on that trip. Good thing we convinced your Ma to go with Solomon to that game convention, or this would be weird.&quot; 

&quot;She needed to be his impulse control,&quot; and suddenly it was Yugi. Smooth, simple. Switches like that were rare. &quot;Knowing him, he&#39;d spend the store&#39;s whole budget on random things that&#39;ll never sell.&quot; He stood, and helped Joey roll out the futon. 

&quot;it ain&#39;t much, but, I slept on this thing for a good month before we got the closet set up. It&#39;ll do ya for a night.&quot; 

&quot;Joey, you make it sound like we keep you in a closet.&quot;

&quot;You <em>do.</em>&quot;

Yugi folded his arms. He looked back at the younger Yugi. &quot;Joey lives here. You know how small this place is. We converted the walk-in upstairs into a room for him. He started to before we graduated high school.&quot;</span>

“Futon’s fine.” He looked at the older Yugi. “Joey lives here now? That’s great!” Honestly, he wasn’t a fan of Joey’s home situation. “Maybe I should convince my Joey to move in… I bet he’d be happier.”

He stared down at his hands, tapped his fingers together. “Thanks for letting me stay. Keeping me company. I appreciate it.”</span>

Which reminds me,&quot; 

Joey nudged the older Yugi. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go get food. I&#39;ll be back in a sec, awright?&quot;

Yugi nodded. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t burn the house down or something.&quot;

Joey gave him a pointed look. Yugi shoved him. &quot;Don&#39;t be mean to me!&quot;

Joey laughed and waved on his way out, nabbing his keys off the table. Then, it was just the two of them again. Yugi felt a little awkward, fussing with his sleeves. What could he say to the two of them? Joey wasn&#39;t his buffer anymore...

Oh! Right. Perfect. He held up a hand and left the room for a moment before returning with two small deck boxes. &quot;Cards are pretty different now...You wanna see some of them?&quot;</span>

Yugi sat on the floor in front of the coffee table, opening up the first deckbox. He produced his deck, and pulled out some of his favorites. &quot;You know Dark Magician, of course...Hmm. Dark Magician Girl, maybe?&quot;

He spread them out. There were various cards that featured Dark Magician on them- Magician&#39;s Rod, Magician&#39;s Souls...It was very good. There was also a Red Eyes in there too.</span>

He leaned forward, looking at the cards laid out in front of him. “Dark Magician!” Of course he recognized Dark Magician. “I didn’t know there’s a Dark Magician Girl! She’s cute.”

He didn’t recognize most of the other cards he was shown. But he oohed and aahed over them, looking each one over. The future had really cool looking cards! He paused when he saw Red Eyes, though. “Red Eyes Black Dragon! That’s Joey’s card!”</span>

Joey, going pro… “I bet Joey’s doing great at it!” Excited, Yugi tapped his feet against the ground. “It’s okay that you’re not playing professionally, though; you have your own dream.”

He giggled, taking his partner’s hand. “He’s very round, partner. He’s perfect.” He looked at the older Yugi. “Before we, um, got in a relationship, I got Yami a gift. A card pack for him to open. There was a Kuriboh in there. It’s very special to him now, special to both of us. So seeing more Kuribohs in the future makes me really happy!”

He frowned. “Is he a ritual monster, though? The card is blue, but it looks different…”</span>

&quot;Oh yeah, I would never let Kaiba stop printing them. I make him make a new one every so often.&quot; Yugi giggled. &quot;Can&#39;t help they always do well.&quot;

He set out the cards. &quot;These are called Link Monsters. They&#39;re a different kind of monster, they&#39;re in your Fusion Deck too. They call it the Extra Deck now.&quot;  He pointed link rating in the corner. &quot;This tells you what you need to do to summon it. For Linkuriboh, he only needs to have one card tributed. But someone like Accesscode Talker needs four.&quot; 

He continued, &quot;The arrows change what the cards do, depending on what they point to on the field. They&#39;re like tribute summoned monsters, with really special effects.&quot;

<em>You are being so kind,</em> he flushed, feeling pressure on the back of his neck. He smiled all shy. &quot;We have special cards, too. This Dark Magician has been with us for a long time.&quot; He pulled out one, and it was clearly very well played.</span>

“They look like a lot of fun to play,” he said honestly. “But they all have such complicated effects. When did the game get so…text-heavy?” That wasn’t a bad thing! It was just very different from the card game he was used to. A lot of his monsters didn’t even have effects.

Dark Magician! He smiled. He clearly had served the older Yugi and Yami well. “I can tell he’s very special.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out his deck. He drew the top card off, which just happened to be Dark Magician, and held it next to the other to compare. It had clearly seen a bit of use, but was overall still in fairly good condition.</span>

Right- Kaiba. Did he run Duel Monsters at this point? Yugi wasn&#39;t sure. 

Oh wow. Seeing the Dark Magician looking so...<em>nice</em> was surprising. A little nostalgic, too. It made him smile. <em>It seems they care, just as we did.</em>

&quot;Hm-&quot; Yugi opened the second deck box he had brought out, and quickly fanned through some of the cards. He pulled a few out face down- four, exactly.

I don&#39;t think you can play these, but...&quot; He turned them over, and each were one of the Kuriboh brothers- they were all different colors. Yami gasped. 

<em>&quot;They look different.&quot;</em> He murmured, peeking at them. <em>&quot;Are they his friends?&quot;</em></span>

“Kaiba runs the game in the future? Somehow that doesn’t surprise me.”

Yugi looked closely at the Kuriboh brothers. Each a different color, each with a different expression. They seemed like a lively bunch. 

“‘Are they his friends?’“ he repeated so the older Yugi could hear. He tapped his fingers together. “Are you sure? I mean, I don’t want to break apart your deck…”</span>

If there was <em>anyone</em> Yugi did not feel much remorse about over the years, it was fucking Weevil. He felt the hum of agreement at the back of his mind. &quot;That kid is going to unfortunately be a pain in your side for a while. Yami, you should do me a favor and just,&quot;

He motioned with his hands, hitting his flat palm. &quot;Just hit him <em>really</em> hard.&quot;

It made the younger Yami laugh. <em>&quot;I have not done physical violence in a long time. But, hm. I would consider an exception. I also don&#39;t like him very much.&quot;</em> 

<em>I like this one,</em> Yugi heard, <em>He does remind me of myself.</em>

&quot;So you went to Duelist Kingdom, huh.&quot; Yugi leaned back, holding himself up with his hands behind him. &quot;How did that last duel go?&quot; 

He wondered if it had been the same- the duel with Pegasus.</span>

…Right?

Now he was laying in a field of sunflowers. When did he get here? How did he get here?

Yugi smiled, turned to face Yami again. He placed a hand over one of Yami’s. 

“This is my partner. I always feel safe around him, so if he feels safe around me, that makes me so happy. He makes me happier than anyone else.”

He leaned down to leave a brief kiss on Yami’s forehead. He couldn’t help it, his partner looked so cute while he slept.</span>

...Should he <em>tell</em> them?

This was just a dream to them, after all. What harm would it bring?

He looked down at his puzzle. This was a dream. He’d been told this was a dream. So what harm could it possibly be to let someone look at his puzzle? 

And, the pharaoh was Yugi’s friend. It wasn’t like <em>Weevil</em> was asking.

“Of course. I trust you.” Reaching around his neck, he lifted his puzzle over his head before holding it out for the pharaoh to take.</span>

He took the pharaoh’s hand and stood up next to him. “What did you want to show me?”</span>

Domino Museum?

He kept holding Yugi&#39;s hand. <em>&quot;They wanted me to give you guidance. They were worried of you. When Pharaohs pass on, we become like Gods. And sometimes we can speak to the living. Especially if they ask as nicely as he did.&quot;</em>

And he always did. Always so sweet, and proper with it, their prayers well researched and put together. 

<em>&quot;You cannot be harmed here. But I know that pull has brought you to this place in the waking world. Let me show you what it wants. Perhaps it will soothe you worries.&quot;</em>

He wasn&#39;t sure. But, this was just a dream. Dreams did not change destiny, he reminded himself.</span>

Yugi felt his feet begin to drag as he recognized the building in front of them. The last time he saw the museum had been during that nightmare, where Yami had been trying to convince Yugi to look for those memories. 

No…Yami wasn’t here. It was just Yugi and the pharaoh. This wasn’t the nightmare he had. He was safe here, he had to believe that.

Yugi forced a smile. “Maybe it will… I won’t lose my partner if I see, will I?” He needed to be sure. It was important he did so before taking one step into that building.</span>

There was a device that looked misplaced- it looked somewhat futuristic, a disk like object with an arm extended out from it. And- were those duel monsters cards?

He pulled Yugi forward before they could spend too much time there. Near the back, there was a soft light on a stone tablet. It was carved out in intricate ways, where it showed two people seemingly in battle, and...

Oh.

One of them looked just like Yugi. He didn&#39;t speak for a few beats, letting Yugi look it over. 

<em>&quot;This image looks much like you, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;</em> He asked, reaching out. He put his hand on the glass. <em>&quot;And that looks like Dark Magician, too.&quot;</em> He gestured to the monsters- one looking like Blue Eyes, and the other Dark Magician.</span>

Yugi was too nervous to pay much attention to the displays. He knew from his experiences at this museum that they weren’t what he was here for.

The tablet. He could tell immediately the tablet. He couldn’t stand to look at it last time he’d been here, in a nightmare. But now he forced himself to look.

And now that he was looking, he couldn’t look away.

He place his hand against the glass. “But…why would Dark Magician be here? Why is there someone that looks like me? And that’s…Kaiba’a monster…”

He didn’t understand. How did this relate to the king’s memories? How could someone that looks like Yugi be part of them?

He pushed back the whispers of his nightmare, promising him a place in the king’s memories at his side.</span>

“You’re…” Oh, it made sense. The Pharaoh inside the puzzle. But this person was much nicer than the one he’d played a shadow game against. 

His name was the seal… So if Yugi learned his name, would he and Yami be free? Free of the king’s memories? No longer weighing them down like a puzzle around their neck…

Yami didn’t want the king’s memories. Yugi just wanted Yami to be happy, to give his partner what he wanted. If he could prevent his partner from suffering any longer…

The words came out in a whisper.

“What’s your name, Pharaoh?”</span>

And here he was sending mental prayers to those listening. All he wanted was the protection of him, to allow him a life of happiness away from all of what would come. That had to be noble. And if it was truly an issue, then...he was sure the Gods would have stopped him.

But this was just a dream. Dreams did not change reality.

He leaned down, and whispered in his ear. <em>&quot;It is...Atem. My name is Atem.&quot;</em></span>

Yugi stared up at the Pharaoh. Would this really free them? Could he really give Yami the happiness and freedom he deserved by just learning a name? 

It seemed too good t be true. Perhaps it was. But he wouldn’t find out if he didn’t try.

“Atem…” he whispered. “Your name is…” Even if nothing came of this knowledge, Atem must trust him a lot to trust him with his name. 

“Thank you.”</span>

<em>&quot;I know you will take the knowledge seriously.&quot;</em> 

He went to say something else, before he looked to the door. Tired footsteps brought Yami to the pair, where he wrapped his arms around Yugi and put his head on his shoulder. &quot;Where did you go,&quot; he mumbled softly. He still appeared to be half asleep. 

Atem couldn&#39;t help but laugh softly. <em>&quot;You two are very cute.&quot;</em>

Yami glanced up at Atem. &quot;Mm...? Who is this, partner?&quot;

Atem paused, before laughing at himself this time. Oh what a (after)life. <em>&quot;My name is Atem. Yugi and I were just talking. Perhaps it is time for you two to wake up.&quot;</em></span>

And oh, what a relief it was to see his partner. Yugi pressed a gentle kiss against the side of Yami’s head. “I didn’t go far, partner.”

His cheeks did turn red, though, when Atem called him cute. 

Yugi tapped his fingers against each other. “We can’t stay asleep forever…” Even if it was nice, having Yami’s arms around him like this. He looked up at Atem. “Will I see you again? You’ve been really nice and helpful. I really appreciate it.”</span>

It made him feel an odd emotion. He missed his own Yugi all of a sudden. 

<em>&quot;I&#39;m already with you,&quot;</em> He pointed to the puzzle. <em>&quot;Even if I am...a little angry, sometimes. He has been full of anguish for a long time, and very lost. I think, though...As I was taught, you will teach him how to be gentle.&quot;</em>

Yami yawned. He still didn&#39;t seem awake, like this dream was only Yugi&#39;s, and Yami was here by a technicality. 

<em>&quot;But, if you want to see <strong>me</strong> again, hmm...Ask Yugi how to pray to me. I think he will be able to answer.&quot;</em> 

He smiled, and waved his hand. The dream around them seemed to fade, like he was pushing them to wake up. 

<em>&quot;...It was nice to see you,&quot;</em> He murmured. He was sad to have them go, and hoped that Yugi would not see the tear he didn&#39;t want to slip down his cheek. <em>&quot;Boy with two hearts.&quot;</em>

-

&quot;Jeez, is he still snoozin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Be nice, Joey, he had a long day!&quot; 

Their whispers were harsh at each other, the two of them in the kitchen. There was the smell of pancakes, and a complaint here and there between Joey and Yugi.</span>

He yawned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He reached around him semi-blindly until he found where he had set the puzzle for the night and quickly put it around his neck. 

“Morning, partner,” he mumbled, resting a hand against the puzzle. 

He rolled slowly towards the edge of the futon slowly before sitting up. His nose was beckoning him towards the kitchen, but that dream was still fresh in his mind.

He glanced down towards the puzzle. This whole time, he’d been afraid of the spirit in the puzzle. But Atem was nice. Was it really possible to get along with the spirit in the puzzle? 

…His memories were still so fresh. The nightmare of Yami tempting him to find the memories, the reality of playing a shadow game with the puzzle. 

Yugi’s stomach growled. Those pancakes smelled really good. He slowly got up and made his way towards the kitchen.</span>

<em>&quot;I don&#39;t remember if we had a dream.&quot;</em> Yami murmured, his own voice thick with drowsiness. <em>&quot;I feel as though I could sleep longer, though.&quot;</em></span>

“I think we slept pretty well. We had a very…interesting dream.”

Yes, meeting an Egyptian pharaoh and going out to the one place he tried his hardest to avoid these days. An interesting dream, indeed.

He stared at his pancakes, his cheeks turning pink. “What did I…say?”</span>

Yami had flushed a little, but it did make him smile. <em>&quot;That is cute of you, partner.&quot;</em>

When Yugi had finally stopped terrorizing Joey, he sighed.

Ugh, his head hurt. He gestured for Yugi to sit down while he grabbed a bottle on his desk. He shook a pill from it and took it dry. He sat at his desk. &quot;Can you tell me, exactly what happened in your dream, please. Front to back. It&#39;s really important.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yugi yelped as he was dragged up the stairs. Once he was no longer being dragged, he sat don on the floor. 

From would he could gather based on what Atem told him...this probably was important, yeah. And he&#39;d just blurted it out without thinking about it. Yeah, he should have handled the subject much better.

Yugi fiddled with the puzzle in his hands, passed it back and forth from one hand to the other. &quot;I woke up in a field of sunflowers, and Yami was sleeping next to me... He said he was expecting to see someone else, but he told me I was dreaming and called himself &#39;Pharaoh&#39;. He asked to see my puzzle. And he said that because Yami didn&#39;t disappear when he took the puzzle, that Yami&#39;s not connect to the puzzle... He said Yami&#39;s a part of me.&quot;

He stared at his feet. &quot;He said Yami and I might have to be apart for a while some day, though... I said I&#39;d fight as hard as I could to stop that from happening.&quot;

He looked down at the puzzle. &quot;He asked me if I&#39;d felt a pull from the puzzle to search for something... I told him about the memories the puzzle wants to look for, and that my partner and I didn&#39;t want to look for them... That I didn&#39;t want those memories to break my partner and I apart. He said nothing could break us apart, and asked to show me something.&quot;

...He was extra nervous, now. Yugi fiddled with the chain around his neck. &quot;He said someone wanted him to give me guidance, and he took me to... the museum. The one in Domino City. The last time I went there, I played a shadow game against the puzzle... The last time I dreamt of it, my partner was trying to convince me to look for those memories. But he said I couldn&#39;t be harmed in this dream, that seeing what the puzzle wanted might soothe my worries. I asked if I&#39;d lose my partner if I looked, and he said we wouldn&#39;t. So I agreed. We went inside the museum.&quot;

&quot;He took me to the stone tablet.&quot; He looked up at Yugi. &quot;I&#39;m assuming you know the one... The one connected to the king&#39;s memories. He let me look at it... He told me why I was destined to solve the Millennium Puzzle. He told me the nature of the spirit in the puzzle, and that the spirit in the puzzle wants to find his name. He said <em>he</em> used to be the spirit inside the puzzle, that he knew the name of the spirit in the puzzle. That it was his name, too. And...he told me his name.&quot; 

&quot;Then my partner came and found me... He said we were cute. And he said we should wake up soon. I asked if I&#39;d ever see him again, and he said the spirit of the puzzle was still with me, but if I wanted to see him specifically, to ask you how to pray to me.&quot;

Yugi stared at the floor. &quot;And then I woke up.&quot;</span>

                        <span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Yami sat beside him, listening patiently. He had mixed feelings as Yugi recounted this story. What reason had he to trust the person in his dreams...? What if this had been just another manefestation of the puzzle, trying to push them apart-

&quot;Ohhhhh my god,&quot; Yugi cut in, &quot;Ohhh my GOD he told you his name?! &quot;

Yugi had gotten up, and started pacing the room as his younger self recounted the dream. He then shoots a glare to the altar on his desk- which comprised exactly of a half burnt incense and a golden plate. &quot;I ask- I asked for guidance, you asshole, not this!&quot; He&#39;s glaring at that golden plate like it insulted him- it may as well. &quot;I give you homemade bread and you do this to me! You&#39;re giving me a he-agh-&quot;

He holds his head, stumbles back into his desk chair. He takes a few moments to breathe and stop yelling at a stupid golden plate. He looks at his younger self apologetically. 

&quot;I&#39;m not mad at you. I&#39;d- uh, better...explain.&quot;

He was hoping to have avoided this. 

&quot;You...Well, you were dreaming. But you were being visited by the soul of a Pharaoh, too. I...I was worried about you, and I asked him to give me guidance. Well...typical him, took it into his own hands, I guess.&quot;

Yugi reached into his desk, and started to shuffle a deck of playing cards. Yami blinked. He thought how weird it was to watch the older Yugi do the same thing that he would. &quot;That was the spirit in my puzzle. But unlike you, I did look for his memories. We were guided by his spirit to look for them...And there was good reason for it. There were people trying to use the power in the Millennium Items- like your puzzle- to do terrible things. Finding his memories meant saving our friends, and making sure that everything was going to be alright.&quot;
He felt his heart start to ache. He seemed to blink, slow, trying to fight off a switch. &quot;When it was over...The Pharaoh had to leave. He was a spirit who wasn&#39;t meant to be here. And now that we had solved the puzzle of it all...&quot;</span>

&quot;He and I dueled. The Pharaoh was amazing at dueling, he was...He fought all of my battles for me. So this was our final test. Had he given me what I needed? Had I surpassed him?&quot;

He shuffled. 

&quot;I did. I beat him.&quot;

The sound of the riffle shuffle was the only thing keeping him from flashing back to that time. To the sight of him walking away. He was glad that stupid incense wasn&#39;t lit, because he would definitely be able to feel the torrential wave of emotions flooding the system back here in the waking world. 

&quot;And he left. And I was alone. For a long time. That&#39;s what he meant, when he said you may have to be separated. We didn&#39;t know that Yami wasn&#39;t the Pharaoh. When he left, Yami thought he was gone too, and we stopped talking to each other. We didn&#39;t know we were still...together. And then a few months ago, he started coming out again. But he thought he was the Pharaoh, and was convinced he was...&quot;

He shook his head. &quot;That doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m sorry. He was my first friend...my eternal friend. I...we miss him every day.&quot; 

He looked at the puzzle around Yugi&#39;s neck. 

&quot;If he said you&#39;re like me, I&#39;d believe him. He...He&#39;s smart. Thoughtful. Always was.&quot;

He shuffled the deck again. Yami looked away from it, finding the carpet more interesting. To him, it was starting to look like hearts and spades. 

&quot;Don&#39;t tell anyone his name. There&#39;s a reason it was a secret. I- I don&#39;t know what you knowing is going to do. But...&quot;

Yugi had started bouncing his knee. He sighed, set the deck down. &quot;...If you want to talk to him again, he likes fresh bread, and...pancakes. Incense, too, sometimes. If you just follow your heart on which one to use, you&#39;ll probably get it right.&quot;</span>

Why was the older Yugi&#39;s Pharaoh so gentle and kind when the younger Yugi&#39;s Pharaoh was willing to choke and stab him to get what he wanted? He couldn&#39;t help feeling a bit jealous.

Yugi stared at his hands. &quot;I won&#39;t tell anyone his name, I promise. That secret&#39;s safe with me.&quot;

Even if he and Yami were destined to be apart... He couldn&#39;t let it happen. He&#39;d fight against it with everything he had. Anything, for his partner.

&quot;Fresh bread, pancakes, and incense.&quot; He nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll remember that. If I ever need to talk to him again... I&#39;ll know how to look for him.&quot;

How had the older Yugi befriended the spirit of the puzzle in the first place? He wasn&#39;t sure whether to try to befriend his own now or continue to avoid anything it desired. He was still leaning toards the latter.

And besides... &quot;If you and A-- you and the Pharaoh were such good friends, why did he have to leave? Why couldn&#39;t he stay, and let you and Yami stay together, too?&quot;</span>

For a moment, the world felt at standstill. He knew it was just- it was his younger self&#39;s lack of understanding about the situation. He was still a kid, he-

He still <em>had</em> the puzzle. 

Yugi took a breath in. He heard Yami at his back reminding him to breathe, so he complied. How was he supposed to explain this when what needed to come out of his mouth, not even he believed? Did he lie? Or did he say how angry he was at Atem for leaving him, how every day even Yami wondered where he was, wished for the presence of the warmth they had both lost?

He picked back up the deck. This time, he practiced his swing cuts, each one rolling between his fingers easily. He didn&#39;t respond for a little while. 

&quot;...Complicated,&quot; he finally mumbled. &quot;He was...He was not in the puzzle by...his full choice. Thousands of years ago he sealed himself in that puzzle to protect his people...when the threat had passed, uhm...&quot;

Shoot. Breathe, in, out. This wasn&#39;t the time to cry in front of his younger self, this was the time to be confident, to use everything Atem had taught him-

&quot;H-He, uhm, w-wanted to g-go home.&quot; He rushed out the words. He dropped a packet of the cards. It always hurt to think of it like that. Home had been here, home was with him, and- 

He rubbed his eyes. Tried to make the oncoming tears go away. &quot;S-Sorry. I- It&#39;s been years, a-and...&quot;</span>

He wanted to say that Atem going home was good, they had done what they were supposed to do, but <em>god</em> all it felt like was abandonment. Like his usefulness had run out and now there was nothing to stay back for. He tried to control his emotions about it, but he felt them trying to push against the effects of his medicine, making him want to get sick. A few moments passed, and when he lowered his hands, Yami spoke next. 

&quot;He left because we all felt it was the correct course of action. He was dead, long-since so. The afterlife was the next logical step. Pharaohs are promised godhood once they pass on, and joining their families.&quot;

He looked at the packet of cards that had fallen on the ground. The younger Yami had shied away from it. Upright were the King of Spades, the four of hearts. He reached down and scooped the cards up. &quot;...It is just sore for him. When you...love someone for so long, and must let them go, it can feel like a part of you is missing.&quot;

The next, he said quieter. &quot;I may be the person Yugi loves, but we <em>both</em> loved Atem, too.&quot;

Yami&#39;s swing cuts were not as precise. He could only round the cards around his thumbs. 

The younger Yami finally spoke up. <em>&quot;P-Partner,&quot;</em> he hated the shake in his voice. <em>&quot;D...Does this want to make you find its memories? The words of their Pharaoh?&quot;</em>

Yami glanced at him. Noted his fear, noted the way his chest was jumping a little with each breath. Telltale things he had seen himself do. Knew that emotion like this was never, <em>ever</em> shown in front of untrusted people. Reserved for quiet places, where no one else could find them.</span>

They both loved Atem?

Yugi…could see why. Their Atem was so nice, so wise… He’d appeared in a dream to help Yugi out even though he was a <em>stranger</em>. 

He felt jealous, again. This Yugi and Yami got someone they loved, and he had someone who was willing to <em>stab and choke him</em> for what he wanted.

Then his partner spoke, and he could feel his heart breaking. He reached out and wrapped his hand around his partner’s wrist.

“Partner… I know you don’t want to find those memories. And I don’t, either. The only memories I want…are the ones we make together.”

He reached his other hand up to cup his partner’s face. “He said if we look for them, we would have to be separated. Even if it’s not for forever, I…I couldn’t stand to lose you. Without you, I… I don’t care if it’s our destiny. I’ll fight against any destiny for as long as it takes to keep you by my side. <em>You’re</em> the one I want, partner.”

Yugi leaned forward and kissed his partner on the cheek. 

He couldn’t let there be any doubt in his partner’s mind. Even if his dream answered a lot of unknowns and questions, it hadn’t changed how he felt. About finding the king’s memories. About his partner.</span>

&quot;...If you do not intend to look...You will have to learn to coexist.&quot; The older one said softly, not wanting to scare the image of himself any more. &quot;You also must understand...there are people who want what the puzzle gives you. And giving it up will have the same effect as it did to us. It will be harder to connect with him. You will not be able to see him anymore. So you must make a choice...Do you give up the puzzle, and live like that- and damn the soul within it- or do you fight to keep it?&quot;

Yami kept cutting the deck over and over, and he looked away from the two of them. Just staring a bit off into space. 

&quot;...He isn&#39;t very nice to you, is he. The spirit of the puzzle. He seems angry, doesn&#39;t he.&quot;</span>

He didn’t want to…<em>hurt</em> the soul in the puzzle. He didn’t want to <em>abandon</em> him. But could they really coexist with him? 

Yugi didn’t like either choice. He didn’t want anything to change. He didn’t want the spirit in the puzzle to hurt his partner, anymore, either.

“He’s hurt us before. He played a shadow game against us, he’s caused so many nightmares. I don’t want him to hurt my partner anymore…”

Even if they helped the spirit in the puzzle, it would still hurt them, wouldn’t it? Atem had chosen to leave people that loved him, had chosen to abandon them for what was supposed to be his destiny.

“He called me his servant. Tried to force us to look for his memories. I don’t know how to coexist with someone like that.”

He looked towards his partner again.

“But, if I couldn’t see my partner anymore, if we couldn’t connect anymore… I don’t know how I’d keep going like that. My partner means everything to me, I…”

He teared up. He couldn’t stand to lose what he had with his partner now.</span>

But he didn&#39;t. He took a deep breath. He turned to the desk and picked up the nearby lighter, lighting the incense over their makeshift altar. If they were going to talk so much about him, he may as well start listening. 

&quot;What I wouldn&#39;t give to have what you have,&quot; he said, looking at the way the smoke came off the incense. It was a gentle smell, nothing terribly strong. (Couldn&#39;t be- if Gramps found out they were praying to deities, he may have a heart attack.) &quot;I understand why you want to keep it.&quot;

He made himself look back at them. &quot;The person you met in our dream, acted exactly as you describe to us. He did things to people we cared about, not wanting to admit that his desires were driven by wrath. He and I were the same person for a very long time...I suppose I may be biased. But I know there is good there, even if he is angry. It just takes time. Your heart is pure, Yugi. There is no better soul in thousands of years to teach him gentleness.&quot;

And those memories...Yami didn&#39;t have the answer to that part. &quot;Pegasus told you at Duelist Kingdom that there was evil inside of the Millennium Items. That the answer lied in finding those memories. Put yourself in his shoes...He is our age. If you awoke to a prison, and you don&#39;t know what crime you&#39;ve committed- you would fight against it too, wouldn&#39;t you? If someone offered a way to clear your guilt, you&#39;d fight for it too, right?&quot;

Took a breath in, out. It tasted like the earth, the smell of the incense. He could hear Yugi praying, quietly, in his mind. A nervous habit, now. Maybe he would really start listening, then.</span>

People could change. People were capable of change. The spirit in the puzzle…he was a person in there. So he must be capable of change, too, right?

He was just a person, lost and confused. So the spirit of the puzzle… So <em>Atem</em> must be capable of change, too. He just needed help to get there.

“I can try to…to teach him gentleness. If the Pharaoh used to be like that, if the spirit of the puzzle can learn to be like he is… Then maybe we can coexist after all.”

The idea was still scary to him. There would probably be bumps in the path. They could get hurt again. But…

“If coexisting lets my partner stay at my side… I’ll do anything for him.”</span>

He pretended to not hear him. He looked to the window, which had started to darken. He didn&#39;t recall the weather forecasting rain. 

&quot;...It may be time for you to return home. I am sure your friends are wondering where you are.&quot;</span>

He frowned, looking at the window. “I did leave without telling anyone… I hope Joey and Honda and Anzu don’t mind. Oh, and Grandpa, he’s probably worried…”

He and Yami could talk more at home, in private. He wanted to soothe his partner’s worries, but his partner seemed uncomfortable here, with the other Yami.

Yami went for it, grabbing it up from the desk. He frowned at it for a moment. This one was out of his league. He looked back down at his counterpart. 

Before he let Yugi back out to figure it out, he approached them, and scooped them into a hug. It was tight and close and he sighed. &quot;I am sorry for what may come from our meeting. But I am honored to have met you both.&quot;

When they parted, it was Yugi. He fussed on their phone and the way home opened up in his room, just like it had before. He jumped a bit in surprise. 

&quot;Ah- uhm, don&#39;t be a stranger?&quot; He smiled sheepishly. &quot;Be safe, okay?&quot;</span>

He looked at the portal for a moment, before looking back towards Yugi. “We’ll keep in touch. And we’ll stay as safe as we can. I promise.”

He couldn’t promise staying completely safe. Not without lying. But he could come as close as he could to it.

With a smile, he glanced at his partner. “Let’s go home, partner.” And then he stepped through the portal.</span>
