It had grown since the last time he was here, it had gained furniture and a coziness that could only be attained with love. It glowed in that way, and Rockman felt like he could relax here. How lovely...
He relaxed against the couch back, sinking into it. &quot;Sounds like the party will be alright,&quot; he hummed as he watched Enzan wander in with coffee. It was too late for that, but he knew Enzan knew that. Enzan did not need nagging, and the warm smell made Rockman relax more. He could have slept here, and nowadays- that was a tall bill. 
&quot;Business-ey stuff...Been a while, huh?&quot;</span>

He shook his head and scrubbed a little harder.

Rock never called her &quot;princess&quot; anymore. To him, she wasn&#39;t a princess- she was just Pride, just another ally. Special in her own ways, not in her title. He was sure he was the only one who didn&#39;t call her princess- and he could remember KnightMan berating him for it. <em>Ohh how the tables have turned,</em> he cut through his negative thoughts with the train he was on. <em>Now she comes to me for help.</em>
He smiled a little softer, more genuine at the memories.
&quot;I&#39;m more than happy to take the heat for you two.&quot; Rock placed the mug he had been working on down on the drying pad. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll do something silly when Blues and I dance. We usually get the floor,&quot; he recalled other times too. They started to stabilize him, help him. He remembered their first public kiss at those events- now Rockman couldn&#39;t stop. Some part of him did live off the publicity- even if Netto teased him about it endlessly. In fact, that was a bonus. It was a reminder Netto still...loved him. Even if he gave him a hard time at first. 
&quot;It&#39;s mostly girls they target anyhow.&quot; He rolled his eyes. &quot;They should really be targetting Marcatto...Bad press about him wouldn&#39;t make me bat an eye.&quot; 
He was clear about his distain, mostly. Something about him didn&#39;t rub him the right way.</span>

&quot;God, yes-- Poor Pen, she was <em>not</em> ready for that kind of attention when we first were spotted together. She was <em>pissed</em>. She insisted we meet at her apartment after that. Being a secret member of the netpolice and knowing me don&#39;t go well hand in hand.&quot; He remembered her spotting a tabloid and ripping it to shreds-- still a good memory, if he was honest. It wasn&#39;t often <em>she</em> was the one getting heated. 

&quot;Marcatto? Eh,&quot; Enzan shrugged it away. &quot;He&#39;s a punk. Entitled and immature. He&#39;ll grow out of it as I ignore him. Why him? Has Tif been bothering you?&quot;</span>

Rock&#39;s hand unconsciously tightened on the plate he was washing. It was the last one. 
&quot;I don&#39;t really like how he acts with you,&quot; he wasn&#39;t asked to elaborate, but his words started to spill. &quot;How he treats you.

The <em>crack</em> of the plate stopped him short, the half of it hitting the counter and cracking into more pieces. Rockman blinked, looked down at it, before his expression flashed into worry. &quot;O-Oh no! Ohhh no, not <em>again</em> I&#39;m so sorry Enzan-&quot;
He got down to pick up the pieces, trying to fit each back together. What had possessed him? The shadows laughed. Rockman felt his heart twist, painfully, awfully. He&#39;d done bad again, hadn&#39;t he?</span>

Enzan&#39;s hand raised to his neck and he jumped to his feet. Eyes wide, he looked over the broken plate. 

Once he could wrap his head around what happened, Enzan&#39;s shoulders fell. 

&quot;Ah, geez, no, it&#39;s okay Rock don&#39;t worry about it. Just- can you make sure I won&#39;t step on it? There&#39;s a broom beside the fridge. Just throw it away.&quot; He waved his hand, but didn&#39;t move his socked feet.</span>

His arms wrapped around himself. He didn&#39;t want to share, regretted bringing it up. Maybe if he said it quick, it would come away like bandaids. 
Or tear out like broken stitches. 
&quot;Search and Blues went alone to take out the virus last. When Regal let it out to torture me more. Locked me in my comp so I wouldn&#39;t try to- help. I suppose.&quot;
He wanted to stop already. He didn&#39;t make eye contact. &quot;Absolutely went on autopilot for like, a day it felt like. I hardly remember. Next thing I know, I&#39;m stealing a copyroid from Scilabs, going to the hospital and-&quot; He shuddered involuntarily. &quot;Beating on Regal until he told me what I wanted to know.

Cosmoman...He vaguely remembered that. Some discussion with him.</span>

Why was everyone expecting so much of him? Everything had been so clear before all this, the rules had been written, and he could recite them all by heart. Now he was making allowances. Look how friendship had <em>changed</em> him. 

Enzan leaned back in his chair and ran his hand through his hair. &quot;God. <em>Christ</em> he deserves it, but you <em>don&#39;t</em>. That has to weigh on you.&quot; Maybe not <em>exactly</em> what he wanted to say. &quot;We- we can&#39;t just do that... if it was a blur, could some of your processors be muddled?

There he was, getting selfish about the whole thing. 
He felt some fire at the back of his mind. He tried to repress it.
&quot;No one else was going to do it.&quot; Came out anyway, measured. Unnervingly calm. &quot;No one else was going to. That&#39;s what it always has come down to.&quot;
<em>We were going to kill him!</em> Why was he reaching out internally like this? What was this reaction for? They didn&#39;t synch anymore. That was just a survival technique. Nothing more. <em>We were going to end it! We should have finished the job!</em>

He could die, he could go to the stars, he could face Regal once- but that week away changed him. A virus had overwrote much of him. How could Enzan expect him to remain as he was? Why did everyone-
Rockman grit his teeth. &quot;I was tired of what power he had left over me. I took it <em>back.</em> &quot;
If he could own that, maybe it wouldn&#39;t hurt. Consequences and all. <em>Maybe Enzan will arrest me. Boy, Dad&#39;s gonna kill me.</em></span>

&quot;... Regal wanted us to fall into our darker desires. He wanted to elicite evil from us.&quot; Enzan bowed his head to look at his coffee cup. He could be wrong. He spoke with every confidence, so you would never know. &quot;If it gave you healing, I won&#39;t take that from you. But. It doesn&#39;t sound like it did.&quot; 

Blue, steady eyes leveled on Rockman&#39;s face. &quot;That was a long time ago. Think about what power means <em>now</em>. Keep making a life for yourself and your family. Do something fulfulling.&quot;</span>

Family... &quot;Sounds like you&#39;re giving advice to yourself.&quot; He measured the words with equal parts level and restraint. Enzan was giving him that- that <em>face.</em> That coldness. Rockman hated it, impulse dictating he should drag the real Enzan out of that-

His head picked up when Enzan touched him. Rock glanced up at him, and sighed, letting his shoulders fall. His touch was so different now. He still felt...whatever it was that bonded them and kept them alive all that time ago. 
&quot;I think I&#39;m recovered just fine,&quot; he said, finding his head resting against Enzan&#39;s arm. A blink, and it was like Blues&#39;, then back to Enzan.

He blew out a breath. How could he even be sure it was real? He blinked hard again.
&quot;I&#39;ve always trusted you. Even when we first met.&quot; He laughed softly. &quot;Even if you were a little cold to us. Knew you were one to trust.&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">&quot;...That means a lot to me, Rock. Thank you.&quot; Rockman was perceptive-- Enzan definitely couldn&#39;t say the same about him. He&#39;d been suspicious and guarded for over a year after meeting the Hikaris, and only really trusted once Blues did. 

But now Enzan did trust Rockman. Which was why the idea of him running rampage through the hospital was so damn scary. 

&quot;You have so many people to confide in. We both do. Let&#39;s try not to do anything too rash on our own. We&#39;re all a team, okay?&quot;</span>

Ugh. Too big thoughts. It was in the past- he had no reason to think them. 
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said, &quot;I know. I told Blues and Laika.&quot; Eugh, he <em>had</em> told Laika. Should he mention the strange response to Enzan? Laika was always a little off the handle...But never in the way he&#39;d seen. What had Regal done to him?
&quot;...He&#39;s not gonna show up, is he?&quot; Rock looked up at him with those round, innocent eyes. &quot;Regal won&#39;t, right? He can&#39;t mess with us anymore, right?&quot;</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Enzan breathed. He&#39;d told Laika... how long ago? Regal at all was a dangerous subject, made moreso by the <em>violence</em>. Surely that was a big reason Enzan was so scared by the prospect. All of the people he felt so strongly about trusting were compromised.

&quot;I- he...&quot; Enzan looked startled by the question, and had to fight back looking scared. Rockman was soft, despite all the harshness they had been through. &quot;He is... in custody. Under constant watch. And he&#39;s sickly. We will be okay.&quot; 

The words were to convince them both.</span>

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; But the devil always found a way. 
A brief pause. What to do now? Pick up the pieces? To just throw them in the trash like the plate?
&quot;Do you still...&quot; An odd question weighed heavily in his throat. &quot;Do you still feel our link? Ever? I think I do. Sometimes.&quot;</span>

&quot;I think I pushed it away for a while, to reconnect with Blues. Now that we are strong again, yes. Once in a while. It&#39;s a hard feeling to describe, but... I assume you...?&quot; They had to share what he was thinking of, there was no way he was imagining that.</span>
